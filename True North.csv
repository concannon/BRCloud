40,         Every day's the same routine of endless chores and boring details And you know you're waiting for the perfect condition for your ship to set sail But of course the climate's always changing Clining to the past has got you straining Comes the recognition now you're on a mission that is born to fail (Leave it!) Brothers say goodbye Sisters don't you cry All embrace the times Wade into the changing tide Searching for philosophy of life can be a drag on the soul Nowadays we pick and choose the pieces from other people's wisdom of old But of course the climate's always changing Clinging to the past has got you straining Realizing all your most cherished beliefs are subject to rot and mold (come on!) Brothers say goodbye Sisters don't you cry All embrace the times Wade into the changing tide          
45,"         There's a feeling about myself that I can't understand It's a foreboding sense that I see all around the land When the wheel of fortune turns progressively depraved It's the manifestation of a biospheric decay Keep yourself in line, there's no design The new paradigm is crisis time Luxury was privilege and I knew it all along But to let human reason get trumped by emotion is wrong All the bonds were broken when I said I loved you so But rejection of a fantasy is just a way to help you grow Keep yourself in line, there's no design The new paradigm is crisis time There's a feeling about myself, I feel it oh so strong It's a romantic notion and I've cared about it far too long On the crest of progress we can't balance on the wave If the measure of success is only tallied in the lives we save Keep yourself in line, there's no design the new paradigm is crisis time          "
50,         Welcome my son to where the work is never done And the hungry are seldom ever fed The department of false hope is a proving ground for dopes And they'll grind your tiny bones to make their bread (Hosanna) So hold your head up high forgotten man Tomorrow won't be made for you And everybody's gotta try to lend a helping hand For god and man there's nothing more to do It crackled on the radio through bright plumes of the sun The announcer said the age of faith was dead Though the adolescent nation was just looking for salvation The beast of reason reared it's ugly head (Hosanna) So hold your head up high forgotten man Tomorrow's not for me and you And everybody's gotta try to lend a helping hand For god and man there's nothing more to do From your cradle of destruction With the poorest of instruction And the merest sliver of a tune You managed somehow to muddle through So hold your head up high forgotten man Tomorrow's not for me and you And everybody's gotta try to lend a helping hand For god and man there's nothing more to do There is nothing more

I don't mind but I could use a little sympathy I've been blind as a fool can be My dear cruel world do you ever think about me? I can feel so alone with you right here And yet I turn to you for comfort in my despair You are dust and I am bone And I will love your endless gaze of madness until I turn to stone Hello cruel world do you know that you're killing me?

98,         There's something pathetic in the world today And I don't know how it all began As if all the shame and punishment will finally make me understand A word means nothing wanting action Intentions are valuable as deeds And a wound can dog you for a lifetime Unless it only makes you bleed Everybody knows what's in their heart is right I'm just a termite on an ant hill I think about it every single day A senseless being lacking inspiration Just waiting to be blown away Everybody knows what's in their heart is right

144,"         Now, there's a list of catalysts that hold the heart at bay They grip the mind and sap the soul and feed on your dismay And I never understood why you can't see the world this way The lines are drawn at the break of dawn there's nothing to dismay It's no, no, no security No, no no security No, no no security Nothing to dismay The dissonance runs deep in me resort to weak applause Associate and denigrate the root without a cause And just because the overwhelming odds are stacked away What good is should if at most I would? But nothing to dismay It's no, no, no security No, no no security No, no no security Nothing to dismay Well, it's just a solo journey Bewildered and astray But pay no mind to what you find There's nothing to dismay No, no, no, no, no, no, nothing to dismay  No, no, no security nothing to dismay          "
155,"         Solemn regret, transgressions fill my head A measure of success is how well to forget And the past is dead Strewn about the battlefield of life are the remainders of history When convenient we exalt them and pay them such respect As if we're all in an equivalent trajectory And trash piles high in the rubble we forgot The angels of our nature just sit and watch it rot Now, the past is dead Let's focus on tomorrow instead Oh the tragic present said The past is dead Who can say what constitutes the most important sector of society? The dominant portion seek an instant gratification And are proud of intellectual poverty I'd like to be empathetic but I can't The jeopardy is too great to make a stand Now the past is dead Good deeds won't help you get ahead The modern signpost read the past is dead My next great decision is just lying in wait The action might turn out to be the world's most grievous mistake The past is dead More veritable words have never been said The tragic present said the past is dead          "
160,         Some people are almost impossible to live with Some people have faith in the craziest things They follow outdated conventions that were recorded But most of it to me all sounds insane Maybe that's what you need to get you through the night Maybe you've seen the light But you know that popular consensus doesn't make it right Nothing can go on while forever increasing The universe expanding is a different thing But to turn a nasty habit into a virtue Can't replace the need for charity Maybe it's what you need to help you through the night Maybe you've seen the light But you know popular consensus doesn't make it right Like the seed of all creation or a doomsday scheme The future might be bright or bleak But you know popular consensus doesn't mean much to me

It couldn't last They had to crash Some partys are just made that way But when the bell rings The boys will sing Swing low sweet precariat Let's say we try to get this right Said the plutocrat to jesus christ And when the old fox fearing the worst Made his entrance in a hearse Then the nine in black robes all went berserk This is a tale of robin hood in reverse Citizens united I was excited When the kids are united they can never be divided But that was yesterday There's a brand new sham to today Let's say we try to get this right Said the plutocrat to jesus christ Snd when the old fox fearing the worst Made his entrance in a hearse Then the nine in black robes all went berserk This is a tale of robin hood in reverse        
214,         There's a world outside but I can't really make it There's a life to lead but I can't exactly fake it Yet the mood feels right But my island is sinking out of sight I made jetties so they'd catch all the sediment Removed the rocks and every impediment But the tide's rising high to wash away my island in the night The sheltering sky was to be my everlasting lullaby They said that islands were solid as bedrock Standing firm forevermore But over time even basement wastes away to the unrelenting shore There's a lonely seed waiting to be planted I've instructions but desire is wholly absent I'm just a petrel in the storm My island can't protect me anymore
