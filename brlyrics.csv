0,"         You've given it all you can, And your life is in the garbage can, And you say you're tired and dry, Cuz your mind won't let you cry, So you hang up what is left inside And you want to kiss it all goodbye. You're lost in space, you're swirling ever higher, You're lost on your own, you're too far from home. You're no one's friend, you gave it your best try yeah! You're stuck in the drone, of being alone. You turn to light, but all you get is darkness, Your head turns to stone, your numbness has grown. You're stuck inside your little world of rejects, The good world unknown, you're stuck in the drone.        "
1,"         You were the one, You were my everything. Never apart, No one in-between. Then one day, When you went your own way, You felt justified, And I was mortified. But today... You are just a picture And a thousand memories Is all I take with me 'Cuz your smile Is just too much to see. You're just a thousand memories. Fantasies, broken dreams,Reveries, sordid histories. Following my heart,Laden with reaction Without calibration or design. Committed to a trial, A life of understanding. Can't somebody show a sign to you For me to see if you only knew That you were the one... You were the one, You were my everything. Never apart, No one in-between. Then one day, When you went your own way, You felt justified, And I was mortified. But today... You are just a picture And a thousand memories Is all I take with me 'Cuz a picture is worth One thousand memories.        "
2,"         I heard them say that the meek shall reign on earth,Phantasmal myriads of sane bucolic birth. I've seen the rapture in a starving baby's eyes,Inchoate beatitude, the Lord of the Flies. So what does it mean when your mind starts to stray?Kaleidoscopic images of love on the way. Brother you'd better get down on your knees and pay. 1000 more fools are being born every fucking day. They try to tell me that the lamb is on the way, With microwave transmissions they bombard us every day. The masses are obsequious, contented in their sleep. The vortex of their minds ensconsed within the murky deep. So what does it mean when your mind starts to stray? Kaleidoscopic images of love on the way. Brother you'd better get down on your knees and pay. 1000 more fools are being born every fucking day.        "
3,"         I can't believe it, The way you look sometimes, Like a trampled flag on a city street, Oh yeah. And I don't want it, The things you're offering me, Symbolized bar code, quick ID, Oh yeah. I'm a 21st century digital boy, I don't know how to live But I've got a lot of toys, My daddy is a lazy middle class intellectual, My mommy's on valium, She's so ineffectual, Ain't life a mystery? I can't explain it, The things they're saying to me, It's going yayayayayayaya, Oh yeah.

See I'm a 21st century digital boy, I don't know how to read But I've got a lot of toys, My daddy is a lazy middle class intellectual, My mommy's on valium, She's so ineffectual, Ain't life a mystery?

5,"         Well, it was punk-fifteen in the morning And it was time to stand my ground. And as the gawks and stares bombarded me, You know, I didn't even hear a sound. No one gave a damn If I was there or away. If I died and went to hell, They'd throw a party on my grave And they'd all say, ""This kid is just a fool, he'll never be cool. They might as well just ship him off to some other school."" Plain destitute, Just a little too guilty, just a little too soon... That day was just like any other day, No work, and no pay. I knew that paradise was some other place And I'd get there another day. I will find it before I expire 'Cause I've got the desire. Well, it was punk-fifteen in the evening And it was time to set the town on fire. I saw my boots and my hair As reflected in the mirror Reveal a streetkid named desire. I didn't give a damn Because I was just dying to be And as the Hollywood street scene Left its mark on me. I changed from a boy into a man. I said: ""never again!"" I stuck out my chin when I should have ran, Shit in the fan. I was driven so hard By the sound of my heart, But that day was just like any other day, No work, and no pay. I knew that paradise was some other place And I'd get there another day. I will find it before I expire 'Cause I've got the desire. When the walls surround In deeper shades of blue And there's no voice of reason inside you And you search for meaning On an empty shelf, Then you're always dreaming Of somewhere else. Today is just like any other day, No fear, no restraint. I know that paradise is some other place And I will get there another day. You can come with me, No conditions or fares, Somehow, somewhere, I will find it before I expire 'Cause I've got the desire.        "
6,"         I'm going for a walk, Not the after dinner kind, I'm gonna use my hands And I'm gonna use my mind. And who the hell are you to tell me what to do? You can't even tie your own haggard shoes, Your closet is a mess, and your backyard's falling down, And I have no grand ideas or intentions of sticking around. I'm gonna build a world, Independent and exempt, All alone I'll be an empire, With no mortgage and no rent. And I don't need to live in your stinking zoo, You can't even feed the animals donated to you. Your storage sheds are ramshackled, flies decorate the walls, And you expect me to die here in this shit-filled tiny stall? And I know you're watching everything I do, Call me threat to your children, call me socially unglued, Call me master of insanity, unable to relate, Call me lazy, bane, and filthy, Call me monstrous reprobate. I'm going for a walk  And there's nothing you can do, 'cuz I don't have to live like you So I'm going for a walk.        "
7,"         I don't want to live In a world without melody. Sometimes the rhythmic din Of society is too much for me, But purpose is prioritized. These days the goal is win the prize. There's a sleeping resonance we hold Through which we're unified, So let it out!  Don't just get lost in the crowd, No one can deter you from your own path. There's no trip too remote From which you can't come back. And I've got this hunch about you and me, None of us are ready For a world without melody. Melody is the key, It's the surest way To unlock your individuality. Melody is the key, It will set you free! Don't disrelish harmony, Community will make you whole. Work and understanding are the chords Way deep within your soul. They only need to be struck once And the vibrations swell and spread, But if we mute them they decay, Our sensibilities are dead, So let it out!  Don't just be one of the crowd Hesitance and diffidence will do you in And your soul doesn't care For social medicine. And I've got this hunch About you and me, None of us are ready For a world without melody. Melody is the key, It's the surest way To unlock your individuality. Melody is the key, It will set you free! And I know together we could change the world, Just you and me, But I won't live without melody.        "
8,"         See all people in Afghanistan praying to the gods and living in the sand. Somebody’s gonna have to set them free, nobody hears the call or command. But it’s a long way to Harlem, and a long stretch to the king of Siam. And if you don’t have a penny, why should I give a damn? Ad Hominem. You think you’re better than I am? Ad Hominem. You think you’re better than I am. See all the suckers in the handout line living on scraps and they don’t have a dime. Waiting for endless charity devoid of any sense of posterity. Well there’s no Great Depression and there’s no Great Society. And only few go to heaven, all the rest are damned and free. Ad Hominem. You think you’re better than I am? Ad Hominem. You think you’re better than I am. I’m just a soft-cover version of a much harder tale. A walking resemblance of ruts in the trail. Is it possible to divide your ideas and beliefs. Ideas and beliefs. Ideas and beliefs from the people that you don’t like? Ad Hominem. You think you’re better than I am? Ad Hominem. You think you’re better than I am.        "
9,"         Some live, some die,  Everybody wonders why we're here: Should we even try? Philosophers lost in the night. A beacon in the distance, You gotta turn around. Its vestige dimly flickers in elocution sound The modernist's chronometer uptight and underwhelmed,Pretensions of a higher ground. Higher ground... Introspective paradise found. Adam's atoms resound. Economy of nature, The dead and shallow graves, The particles of happiness elude us in remains. A psychosymbiotical reflection on the waves, Eternal as the night and day. Night and day... Omnipresent sealers of fate, Adam's atoms remain. The righteous opposition has led us all astray, One side against the other, one loses, one reclaimed And if reconciliation eludes us everyday, Then will we ever find a way? Find a way... Not with a religionists gaze. Adam's atoms remain. Adam's atoms betray. Adam's atoms remain.        "
10,"         Three thousand miles of wilderness Overcome by the flow. A lonely restitution of pavement,Pomp and show, I seek a thousand answers, I find but one or two, I maintain no discomfiture, My path again renewed. Against the grain, That's where I'll stay. Swimming upstream, I maintain against the grain. Here labeled as a lunatic,Sequestered and content, There ignored and defeated By the government. There's an oriented public Whose magnetic force does pull, But away from the potential of the individual. Against the grain, That's where I'll stay. Swimming upstream, I maintain against the grain. The flow is getting stronger With smaller increments of time. And Eddies of new ideas are  Increasingly hard to find, You need all that the other has, Your right to seize the day, But in all your acquisitions  You will soon be swept away. Against the grain, That's where I'll stay. Swimming upstream, I maintain against the grain. There's a common consensus And an uncomfortable cheer, A reverberating chorus that anyone can hear, It sings ""leave your cares behind you, Just grab tenaciously"", This lulling sense or purpose  Will destroy us rapidly. Against the grain, That's where I'll stay. Swimming upstream, I maintain against the grain.        "
11,"         England Seemed like such a beautiful place from afar, Until one day I saw how miserable things really are. All fantastic images, They only are apparent,Propagated just by hope And desire to share it. Beauty Was the allure that brought me close to you. Loneliness Was the bond that made me stick like glue. All fantastic images, They only are apparent, Promoted by desperate hope That things are somewhere better. I don't have a thing against fantasy, But to chase it down just doesn't make sense to me. If your only hope is simply peace and love, You end up discarding most of what you're made of. All fantastic Images, They only are apparent, Promoted by desperate hope That things are somewhere better.        "
12,"         All good soldiers crack like boulders, The sun climbs up to a razor, violins, New boots and numbers on a chain. All good soldiers... (All good soldiers) Fall in line When they march and shout,(All good soldiers) are a spectacle Marching and singing. Will go anywhere the president says, Because the president believes in God Like all good soldiers should. All good soldiers wait like warheads, When the fighting starts who will be Accountable, a cannibal, a cannonball. All good soldiers, all good soldiers. (All good soldiers) Fall in line When they march and shout,(All good soldiers) are a spectacle Marching and singing. Will go anywhere the president says, Because the president believes in God Like all good soldiers should. It's 6 AM, I can see my breath And the clay dirt is laughing at the weakling boy. Today is the day that I'll write my friends, It's something I've been trying to remember. I had a dream of a wall that was twenty-one stories tall... All...

Will go anywhere the president says, Because the president believes in God Like all good soldiers should.        "
13,"         This song goes out to all the hopeless sinners With grave allegiances so meaningless and vain, The walking wounded in a pageant of contenders Who balance on a rail of pain for just a pail of rain. And everything is barely mist - blood relations and bricks. My expression, my confession, add it up, extract a lesson More than this, once again, like a bullet as a friend, tell me: Can that be all there is? In my rectory of doubt I kneel to pray like one devout As time the great, gray dreamless sleep of a useless modern God Erodes away each storied day, as wretched Adams with hell to pay Contend upon a rail of pain for just a little rain. And everything is dearly missed - blood relations and bricks My expression, my confession, add it up, extract a lesson More than this, once again, like a bullet as a friend, tell me: Can that be all there is? There’s an endless disposition and it doesn’t mean a god damn thing, There’s space for a paper airplane race in the eye of a hurricane. And if pigs could fly, then surely so could I, But this pedestrian knows better than to even try. My divinity is caught between the colors of a butterfly. And everything is dearly missed - blood relations and bricks My expression, my confession, add it up, extract a lesson More than this, once again, like a bullet as a friend, tell me: Can that be all there is?

14,"         I refuse to abuse what is kind to diffuse, But it's there and it's happening to me along the way. As we go through the snow, we cannot forget our foes, But the dinner's always waiting at the table 'long the way, yeah. What you see, not for me, isn't what you planned to be, But you'll have what you wanted in the end along the way. And we'll try as we cry and our brothers pass us by, To be strong through the ages of our tears along the way, yeah. Now we grow as we show that the morals we must know Will be shapen and mistaken by the falls along the way. But forget, don't regret, to find love and happiness Unless you're willing to be strong when they are gone along the way. Like Tommy, you are free, and you will not follow me, Until we see each other once more on the path along the way.        "
15,"         I hate my family, hate my school, speed limits and the golden rule. Hate people who aren't what they seem, more than anything else, American Dream. American Dream's gonna swallow you whole, it's bursting at the seam, It'll sweep you away, so enjoy it today, tomorrow you'll be old thus useless. American Dream... American Dream... American Dream, that's ok, 'cause no one dare give you away. I hate my god, I hate your job, I hate hypocrites and common slobs. Hate people who aren't what they seem, more than anything else, American Dream. Promise me today I'll have a Chevrolet, with whitewalls on the side, One boy, one girl, comfortable lies The American Dream... American Dream... American Dream, that's ok, 'cause no one dare give you away. American Dream! (bleah!)        "
16,"         I don't need to be a global citizen, Because I'm blessed by nationality. I'm a member of a growing populace, We enforce our popularity. There are things that seem to pull us under And there are things that drag us down, But there's a power and a vital presence That's lurking all around. We've got the American Jesus See him on the interstate, We've got the American Jesus He helped build the president's estate. I feel sorry for the earth's population 'cuz so few live in the USA. At least the foreigners can copy our morality, They can visit but they cannot stay. Only precious few can garner our prosperity, It makes us walk with renewed confidence, We've got a place to go when we die And the architect resides right here. We've got the American JesusBolstering national faith, We've got the American Jesus Overwhelming millions every day. He's the farmer's barren fields, (In God) The force the army wields, (We trust) The expressions in the faces of the starving millions. (Because he's one of us) The power up above, (Break down) He's the fuel that drives the clan, (Cave in) He's the motive and the conscience of the murderer. (He can redeem your sins) He's the preacher on TV, (Strong heart) The false sincerity, (Clear mind) The form letters that's written by the big computers. (And infinitely kind) He's the nuclear bombs, (You lose) The kids with no moms (We win) And I'm fearful that he's inside me. (He is our champion!) We've got the American Jesus See him on the interstate. (We've got the American Jesus)We've got the American Jesus Exercising his authority! We've got the American Jesus Bolstering national faith, (We've got the American Jesus) We've got the American Jesus Overwhelming millions every day. One Nation Under God... (ad infinitum)        "
17,"         Everybody is talking about the girl Who went and killed the delivery man, But she looks so kind and gentle, It just doesn't stand to reason. I saw her right there just the other night As stately as a slot machine, But when she looked my way  Something mad as hell came over me, yeah. Anesthesia, Mona Lisa,  I've got a little gun, here comes oblivion. I never loved you, how did you find me? The cops will never prove complicity now. Anna...(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8) All good children go to heaven! I remember your face that August night When we lied about the beautiful time to come, And that crazy old man who came much to late And caused a chain reaction. I've been hanging out here for eleven long years Like a church mouse wondering where the cat has gone, And looking at you now is driving me to distraction.

18,"         It's a love song to the self, a story recapped every day, It's a world of bogus feelings and a world of slow decay, It's a world of laughter hidden by this world of fear and torment, It's a game of strange compulsion, our visceral convulsion: Anxiety for love of life, anxiety for pain, Anxiety, a feeling that you know you can't contain. Anxiety destroys us but it drives the common man. Foundation of society, anxiety. Suppress it if you can. The caste of coffee achievers didn't perform like they planned. The morning rush hour traffic is our play of false elan. So run around your frantic track and lay you down to sleep; Tomorrow's the redemption, we strive for that exception. Anxiety for love of life, anxiety for pain, Anxiety, a fear that you have nothing more to gain. Anxiety destroys us but it drives the common man. Foundation of society, anxiety. Suppress it if you can. What are we angry for? We all need a common cure. That common goal for which you strive: To have more than the other (have more than the other) guy. The quest for truth, the quest for gold, yeah, we end up all the same. The common lie, the righteous cry, we end up all the same. The angry crowd, those lost and found, everybody's all the same. The poet's pen, these words I lend, we all bend to Anxiety for love of life, anxiety for pain, Anxiety, a feeling that you know you can't contain. Anxiety destroys us but it drives the common man. Foundation of society, anxiety.        "
19,"         What you do is what you are, And wishing upon distant stars Won't improve the hole you're in, Won't absolve your deepest sin. But action is no gift from some covert and lofty God, It's dependant and weighty all the same. And it is oh so easy just to keep to yourself, But then you're at the mercy of imbeciles. Now I didn't make up the rules, But clearly we are led by fools. It is wise to know their ways, So you know how not to behave. But sometimes we find ourselves in desperate need And we look to those with privilege and power. It's then we learn compassion sits inert on their shelves. We're at the mercy of imbeciles. No actions is no gift from some masked spirit in the sky. It's reducible to flesh, mind and bone. And it is oh so easy just to keep to yourself, But then you're at the mercy of imbeciles. Imbeciles!

20,"         Maybe it’s too late for intellectual debate, But a residue of confusion remains. Changing with the times and developmentally tortured minds Are the average citizen’s sources of pain. ""Tell me what we’re fighting for."" I don’t remember anymore, Only temporary reprieve, And the world might cease If we fail to tame the beast. From the faith that you release Comes an atheist peace. Political forces rent Bitter cold winds of discontent And the modern age emerged triumphantly. But now it seems we've stalled And it’s time to de-evolve And relive the dark chapters of history. ""Tell me what we’re fighting for."" No progress ever came from war, Only a false sense of increase, And the world won’t wait For the truth upon a plate, But we’re ready now to feast on an atheist peace.        "
21,"         Everybody wants to dance in a playpen, But nobody wants to play in my garden. I see the hippies on an angry line, Guess they don't get my meaning. I'm enchanted by the birds in my blossoms, I'm enamored by young lovers on the weekend, I like the Fourth of July When bombs start flashing... And I wish I had a shiny red top, A bugle with a big brass bell would cheer me up Or maybe something bigger that could really go pop!  So I could make the gardening stop. Come out to play, come out to play, And we'll pretend it's Christmas Day In my atomic... All my scientists are working on a deadline, So my psychologist is working day and nighttime, They say they know what's best for me. But they don't know what they're doing. And I'm glad I'm not Gorbachev 'Cause I'd wiggle all night Like jelly in a pot. At least he's got a garden with a fertile plot And a party that will never stop. Come out to play, come out to play, And we'll pretend it's Christmas Day In my atomic... I hope there's nothing wrong out there, I'm watching from the room inside my room. Come out to play, come out to play, And we'll pretend it's Christmas Day In my atomic garden!        "
22,"         He's the latest superhero with powers so profound. He can leap a dotted line in just a single bound. I know you must have seen him in books and magazines. He's the quintessential mindless modern epicene. His life is meaningful because he gets things done. Bang bang he's dead, chalk up another triumph for our hero, The Automatic Man. It's true you must have met him, he's your best friend and your foe. His opinions are determined by the status quo. A true creature of habit, he smokes three packs a day. When he has an original thought, he forgets it right away. He's a paradigm of carefree living. He's our mentor, disturb him if you can. He's the answer if your peace of mind is lacking. He's our savior, he is the common man. So if you are troubled by the daily bump and grind, Then take another look around and brother you will find... The Automatic Man.        "
23,"         As the sun comes creeping up the mountain and the wind blows over from the sea. Hey, we’re brought into this land like tiny particles of sand, unsure of who we’re smarter than, or what we’re meant to be. As the grains sift coarsely through the hour glass and collect like victims in the bowl. The ungodly force of change erodes all sense of earthly gains. While tending to the mundane will terrorize your soul. And it’s no! It’s no use thinking that you’re wrong. The past is old and gone. It’s best to move along and find your Avalon. Well, I wish that I could tell you it was easy, just take the paved road right to paradise. But the truth is my friends, the pain and suffering never ends. Make amends with medicine, amnesia, and lies. All the grains sift coarsely through the hour glass and they pound like boulders on the brain. All those things you did for fun, never hurting anyone, careless shadows in the sun, just empty and lame. And it’s no . . . it’s no use thinking that you’re wrong. The past is old and gone. It’s best to move along and find your Avalon. It’s no use thinking that you’re wrong. The past is dead and gone. It’s best to move along and find your Avalon. So now the day races from the twilight. How the fields are enveloped by the shade. And the story that you’ll tell, inventory of your well, crack the shell and find the mortar silted and decayed. And it’s no! It’s no use thinking that you’re wrong. The past is dead and gone. It’s best to move along and find your Avalon. It’s best to hurry on and find your Avalon.        "

25,"         Porcelain and alabaster, decaying ever faster,  Unaware of imminent disaster open up your eyes. As you ruminate the hopeless sands of time,  Did you wander out your days lost and resigned? Or recreate the universals in your mind? Everybody is a bastard: my world is like plaster Crumbling apart from pressure of the blaster, waiting for a sign And the momentary pleasures take their turn As a wistful boy runs out of things to learn,  The episodes of yore are never to return. Scare up some hope, you're gonna need it just to cope, You are the decision, numbers don't lie When you bite the dust, was it for purpose or for trust? You'll never relive it, think before you die. Yeah, think! Think before you die.Deficit and depravation - in the wake of desperation Rewrite the morals, rectify the nation.  Now may be your time! As you ruminate the hopeless sands of time,  Do you wonder how your life has been defined? You know eternity can't ever change your mind. You know eternity can't ever change your mind So think!

26,"         It could happen to you, A defect from the wasted outskirts of Los Angeles With a crumpled-up pass for the RTD And no authority or trajectory On the brink of insanity. You'd better believe it, Because it's written all over your face Just a neighborhood reject, Out of step and out of place, You'd better believe it. Would you ever have thoughtPersistence could prevail Against the almost Unbearable weight of the system? With nothing better to do, And no one else who you can look up to. You'd better believe it Because it's written all over your face A political defect, Out of step and out of place, You'd better believe it.

And I'll never make the same mistake: The next time I create the universe I'll make sure we communicate at length. Oh yeah... But until then, better off dead, A smile on the lips and a hole in the head. Better off dead, yeah better than this, Take it away 'cause there's nothing to miss. I'm sorry about the world, How could I know you'd take it so bad? And I'll never make the same mistake, So if you're looking for a patsy  Why not try the entire human race, Just to play it safe? But until then, better off dead, A smile on the lips and a hole in the head. Better off dead, yeah better than this, Take it away 'cause there's nothing to miss. Better off dead, yeah better off dead, Why don't you try pushing daisies instead? Better off dead, yeah better off dead, A smile on the lips and a hole in the head. And I'll never make the same mistake: The next time I create the universe I'll make sure you participate. And I'll never make the same mistake: The next time I create the universe I'll make sure you participate,  Just in case.        "
29,"         No one here can show you where it is but I can point to a sign On the roof of the world without apparent design, The frozen definition of a lunatic ambition to rise.  The air is thin, the future dim, dimension hard to find.  Up on a mountain, encased in solar rays, Beyond electric dreams of inarticulate passion plays, Coming down a mountain, eons have a human ring, The conversation of impassive planets intercepted by a human being. Ratiocination is a practicable way to derive, An attitude or altitude and probity by which to abide Or maybe a theophany of flaming creosote in disguise.  The air is thin, the future dim, dimension undefined.  Up on a mountain, encased in solar rays, Beyond electric dreams of inarticulate passion plays, Coming down a mountain, eons have a human ring, The conversation of impassive planets intercepted by a human being.  Here glaring cold in the crystalline Geometry of night, obscuring Form and tracing faceless fears of Suprahuman immensity in a Patch of sand or a raptor's guileless Shivering intensity, I'm only A visitor, an atom of atoms on a jutting Red spattered synagogue Of granite as it crouches literally in Space, a frozen amoral giant Gazing heavenward forever.  Let's go where the raptor goes, to the mountain in a cosmic glow, We'll have a genuine terrestrial show on a mountain - on a mountain. Let's scan the horizon clean for any trace of human schemes And try to touch upon immortal themes on a mountain - on a mountain. Up on a mountain, encased in solar rays, Beyond electric dreams of inarticulate passion plays, Coming down a mountain, eons have a human ring, The conversation of impassive planets intercepted by a human being.

30,"         This isn't another new fashion, or a new wave plastic trend. Everybody's searching for something but in the meantime let's all just pretend. I've got this feeling and I don't know what it is. This room is overcrowded, man, and I need air to breathe, yeah. Big bang, big crunch, you know there's no free lunch. Kneel down and pray, here comes your judgment day. Big crunch, you know, it's gonna be quite a show. What goes around always comes around, yeah. A million hopeless faces dwell within protected walls, All waiting for a moment in life when they can heed the clarion call. And it's all so oppressive my mind feels like a sieve. This city's overcrowded, man, and I need room to live. Big bang, big crunch, you know there's no free lunch. Kneel down and pray, here comes your judgment day. Big crunch, you know, it's gonna be quite a show. What goes around always comes around, yeah. I think of the countless shadows that have all come and gone, All suffering in the notion of better things to come. If you share these beliefs you know I wish you well, 'cause there's no room left in heaven and there's sure no room in hell, yeah. Big bang, big crunch, you know there's no free lunch. Kneel down and pray, here comes your judgment day. Big crunch, you know, it's gonna be quite a show. What goes around always comes around.        "
31,"         I can recall the warm youth of a summer day, yeah: The sweetest lemonade, the darkest game arcade, And Billy had a yearning in the corner of his mind. It moved him secretly. It moved him powerfully. But prescience was lacking and the present was not all And his aptitudes were carelessly wasted. And challenging life with the abandon of a fool, He squandered the hours of his day. Then darkness and disorder slapped him sharply in the face, yeah. It hit him like a friend, struck something deep within. He couldn't break the chain of slow decay that seemed to drag him Just like a fatal tie toward the other side. And Billy was a lunatic, just barking at the moon, And his brain was totally wasted. He then exchanged his friends for a needle and a spoon And he threw his future away. Bolt the door and throw away the key. Your dim reflection is all that you can see. So where is the justice when no one is at fault And a human life is tragically wasted? How fragile is the flame that burns within us all To light each passing day?        "
32,"         A crack developed and a name blew in, Billy Gnosis, weak and thin. He moved to California to start a new life, Because back in his hometown he just killed his wife. He started drinking every back then, He started eating things that made his head spin, And his brain became a battery, From making chemicals that shouldn't be. Oh, Billy couldn't remember his name, Billy Gnosis was going insane. And soaked in blue light he played and played, I can still hear the sound he made... Billy burned his phone and blew up his car, He sat and watched TV and played the guitar And read a book that made his head dim; How could he have known that there were worms within? And the worms ate into his brain, Through his eyes and through his ears they came. They made a home so they could multiply And feed on Billy's chemicals in paradise. Oh, Billy couldn't remember his name, Our lonesome hero was going insane. And soaked in blue light he played and played, I can still hear the sound he made...        "
33,"         Flying through a dark prismatic tunnel on a carousel, The earth is turning and you know it very well. Your mind is reeling like ten helicopters wheeling  And you're gonna hit the ceiling like a mallet on a bell. Hey, blenderhead, they're starting to ask questions, Your transgressions are a danger flashing sign. Challenge conventions and radiate your splendor And feel those flywheels churn on your blenderhead. Tally up the gleaming tender ventured on a wishing well, Each shining trinket has a story it can tell. Your moments pining like those tales all intertwining Can become the rusted lining of a deep neglected shell. Hey, blenderhead, you ask so many questions, Your confusion's a life-affirming sign. Break from tradition and carry on with valor And feel those flywheels churn your blenderhead.        "
34,"         Drop dead, it doesn’t matter, she said, It only hurts when I laugh, she said. Sometimes, it’s never a crime To spend the day in bed. She made certain that the curtains were red, To dream better by the light they would shed. She leaned back, tilted her head And this is what she said. You can’t win! Think it over again, I can’t win! Look at the trouble I’m in, We can’t win! And we’re stuck here together, Yeah, I hope it will last forever. Don’t ever dare to hope, he said, So I’ll never let down too bad. I know there’s nowhere to go So I’ll just stay here instead. He knew better than to pull on a thread, They unravel like the thoughts in his head. He looked out, it filled him with dread And this is what he said. You can’t win! Think it over again, I can’t win! Look at the trouble I’m in, We can’t win! And we’re stuck here together, Yeah, I hope it will last forever. With good books and looks on their side And hearts bursting with national pride, They sang songs that went along for the ride And the other side complied. They said, ""Hey, man, where do you reside?"" And ""Could it be Mother Superior lied?"" And ""Is it possible too many have died?"" It’s only natural to reply. You can’t win! Think it over again, I can’t win! Look at the trouble I’m in, We can’t win! And we’re stuck here together, Yeah, I hope it will last forever. * ""If you want a picture of the future, imagine a boot stamping on a human face...FOREVER!"" - George Orwell        "
35,"         With nothing better to do, No one to come home to, I woefully conclude To take it out on you. I'm bored to the extreme, This world of foolish dreams. Disillusion, I am not who I seem to be. Yeah sure I might do harm And bear my right to arm,Retribution, If only someone would listen to me. Listen to me, Listen to me, Listen to me, Listen to me. A room, an empty shelf, A book on mental health, I look for inner wealth, By punishing myself. I'm bored to the extreme, This world of foolish dreams. Disillusion, I am not who I seem to be. Yeah sure I might do harm And bear my right to arm, Retribution, If only someone would listen to me. Listen to me, Listen to me, Listen to me, Listen to me.        "
36,"         She said, thanks but I'm broken. I guess you must have misspoken. What a laugh, I've never been chosen by anyone. She was barely a teen, Hanging out in between, Just a part of the scene. With mercurial smile And incurable style, She was only a dream. How's that, he didn't know a thing about Making love to the kind of girl you read about. He said, I'm bound to be broken. My daddy bet that I'd amount to nothing. He won't let anybody show him anything. He was a troubled child, Had been down for a while, Always kept to himself. No she couldn't defend, He only wanted a friend, Now he's made something else. It's so sad, no one saw it coming, The paper said that he hit the ground running. Oh yeah, I know I'm not broken. A little cracked, but still I'm not broken. I wanna laugh, but I think that I'm choking on reality. When the world is turning for you, Don't turn on me, Who are you here to repair, Well I don't know what you mean. You could never resist Glorifying despair, Well now it's coming to you  And I don't really care. While I'm not the kind to insist, You couldn't have missed, we must co-exist. So please listen to me, There is no such thing as human debris. Oh yeah, I know I'm not broken. A little cracked, but that amounts to nothing. I wanna laugh, I'm not joking. I'm unbroken, Oh yeah, I said I'm unbroken, I said I'm unbroken, A little cracked,  it's just a token. I'm really not broken, What a guess, I'm unbroken.        "
37,"         I'm incurable, but durable, it's easy to see Lack of restraint is a complaint of those around me. I know that others postpone Gratification, well, I lack that affectation. Let's get it right, There's no end in sight! And I can't stop Can't stop it Can't stop C-c-c-c-c-can't stop,  Shocking, but I just can't stop it, That's right! Uncontrollable, I'm inconsolable, My pleasure center is the shelter for a reptile. I hate when I gotta tolerate Frustration, see, I lack the motivation. Let's set this straight, I never wait! And I can't stop Can't stop it Can't stop C-c-c-c-c-can't stop,  Shocking, but I just can't stop it, That's right!        "
38,"         Blacktop pavement cover me, Like a chemical reaction or a steam roller Spreading randomly. There's a distant buzz at low frequency It tickles my ear, rumbles under my feet And it shakes the leaves off of every tree Violently. What pretension, everlasting peace, Everything must cease. Institution on the hill, Like a beacon in the mind of an ancestor To ignite a people's will. There's a shadowed stain on the west facade, It has spread like decay to enshroud the fraud And the descendants find it oh so odd. Oh, so odd. What pretension, everlasting peace, Everything must cease. Grave memorial, hewn white stone, Like the comforting caress of a mother Or a friend you've always known. It evokes such pain and significance, What was once is reduced to rememberance And the generations pass without recompense. What pretension, everlasting peace Everything must...        "
39,"         Well the sheaves have all been brought, but the fields have washed away, And the palaces now stand where the coffins all were laid, And the times we see ahead, we must glaze with rosy hues, For we don't wish to admit what it is we have to lose. Millenia in coming, the modern age is here. It sanctifies the future, yet renders us with fear. So many theories, so many prophecies, What we do need is a change of ideas. When we are scared we can hide in our reveries but What we need is a change of ideas. Change of ideas, change of ideas, What we need now is a change of ideas.        "

Brothers say goodbye Sisters don't you cry All embrace the times Wade into the changing tide Searching for philosophy of life can be a drag on the soul Nowadays we pick and choose the pieces from other people's wisdom of old But of course the climate's always changing Clinging to the past has got you straining Realizing all your most cherished beliefs are subject to rot and mold (come on!)

41,"         There was a man who banged his head against a wall, He banged for 20 years, the damn thing wouldn't fall. He left an honest life, he left a broken wife, He left it all behind, just to see what he could find. Millions and millions chase the wild goose tonight. To conquer loneliness they'll chase it all their lives, And when they find it they can just lay down and die. It seems the game is mostly pointless in the presence of the prize. There was a woman who had a man as cold as ice, He built four walls so strong and he kept her locked inside. She harbored loneliness, her husband couldn't guess, That she'd take off her dress and kill herself without a mess.  Millions and millions chase the wild goose tonight. To conquer loneliness they'll chase it all their lives, And when they find it they can just lay down and die. It seems the game is mostly pointless in the presence of the prize.        "
42,"         You took a time bomb And a case of crackers And you made a maelstrom of organic debris. Then you took a work bench And a rusty anvil And you polished them for everyone to see. You have created an unhealthy monster, Yet you're nowhere but nowhere to be found, So I guess I'll just cope with my provisions From now until the day they lay me down. You took a baboon And made him perfect, You took a lion And stripped him of his pride. Then you took a million more varieties, A scalpel and a sartory, And you stitched up a horrible surprise. You have created an unsocial monster Yet you're searched for all over the globe, And most believe that things would sure be better If you'd come down here and tell us what you know. Who is to blame for this? Someone tell me please. His handiwork is flawed And it's there for all to see. Mutations, aberrations and blatant anomalies, They multiply and give rise to this... monstrosity. You took the most abundant smallest bits of matter And you instilled them with affinity, And then you stratified accumulations, Weeded out bad variations Blended up your unique recipe. You have created a powerful monster With direction and purpose all its own, And if you were here, Would things be any different? Or are you just a mosaic of thoughts alone?        "
43,"         These rational delusions have got to cease,  The second hand has finally got the best of me,  I’m too aware about the singularity That brought me to the edge of time. And it’s always on my mind now... They say what has past is coming back some day,  The world is turning faster, but it’s just one way And I’m desperate to try almost anything to abate... A simple chronophobia,  A simple chronophobia now,  A simple chronophobia,  A simple chronophobia now. Maybe there’s a science or technology,  To help me come to terms with my maker. Since natural selection never banked on me,  I must be an exception to the plan. And someone help me understand, now... Cryogenic methods are intractable And collagen polymers aren’t so terrible,  But they still can’t prevent the inevitable farewell.  A simple chronophobia,  A simple chronophobia now,  A simple chronophobia,  A simple chronophobia now.        "

47,"         Death and the shadow that it casts on life scares me little or none. People tell me of a divine right and the happy chosen one. I'm a freak 'cause my morals clash with others in the world. I go home while they work hard, then they say I'm wrong. There's only one place to be, while living with tragedy. If their sins affected me, I gotta be damned to be free. Freedom is responsibility, pay more than it's worth. Instincts tells us not to die, hazy myth since birth. Learn their rules, play their game, deceive yourself in haste. Turn your own brain into dust; it's not theirs to waste. There's only one place to be, while living with tragedy. Extract the nectar, burn the tree, I gotta be damned to be free. Thinking... This world it ain't so bad. Dying... It's just another fad. Working... 8 hours, that's not for me. Dying... It's just your destiny.        "
48,"         Here's a story of an honest man losing religion, Climbing the pulpit steps before an eager congregation, The while praying came a wicked inspiration, Brothers, sisters this is what he said: Dearly beloved, dearly beloved, dearly beloved,  (Make no mistake, despite our traits, I've seldom seen evidence of genes) I can't relate to you, I can't relate to you! He was the kind of guy who'd always go right out of his way, But more before that crazy notion leapt right into his head, And stubbornly crept into every mad perception, I can't deny a funny feeling when he said: Dearly beloved, dearly beloved, dearly beloved, I can't relate to you, I can't relate to you! Dearest in memoriam - set phasers to stun And grab yourself a neighbors' skeleton to lean upon, Did you know him in life - one filled with regret, So soon we all forget - we ever met, Do you know my name - sing a light refrain For a man estranged - I won't deny that I'm inclined to isolate Dearly beloved, dearly beloved, dearly beloved,  I can't relate to you, I can't relate to you! I can't relate to you, I can't relate to you, I can't relate to you!        "

Delirium... delirium... of disorder. Yeah, I am just an atom in an ectoplasmic sea, Without direction or a reason to exist. The anechoic nebula rotating in my brain Is persuading me contritely to persist. Let's go! Delirium of disorder. [x8]        "

55,"         A grizzly scene on my electron beam Told a story about human rights, So all of king's horses and all of king's men  Had a riot for two days and nights.

And maybe Jack did it to Marilyn, But he did it to South Vietnam. For beauty and glory, For money, love and country, Now everybody's doing it, Don't do that to me. A bitter debate and a feminine fate Lie in tandem like two precious babes. While the former gets warmer, it's the latter  That matters except on the nation's airwaves. And custodians of public opinion stayed back  After vainly discussing her rights. Lay hands off her body, It's not your fucking life! I don't know what stopped Jesus Christ  From turning every hungry stone into bread. And I don't remember hearing how Moses reacted When the innocent first born sons lay dead.

It goes for you and it goes for me,  And all the screwed up little girls and boys, All thrown in without a choice. But I heard him say, ""I want out,  No complaints and no doubts,  Just a chance to go on."" I heard a word, suicide,  And not from one, but from thousands that died.  Want some attention and a little less regret,  A teenage bluff, little threat. And there are those, there are those who think  That drastic actions will make them unique.  It's really all the same,  That no one's happy and nobody's to blame.  And the moral to this story is old.  It's quite taboo, seldom told.  The seed is reaped before it's sown,  A man's choice is never his own.        "
58,         I had a dream of unity  Where we could work side by side But today I see that it's only me  Just trying to get by Sometimes we strive undeterred To walk as one toward our goal  But as people stray towards more selfish ways We see we have no control I had a dream of unity Where we would work side by side But today I see that it's only me Just tryin' to get by just tryin' to get by        
59,"         The smell of virgin pages wafted through the swinging doors And the croaking speech he'd heard from countless counselors before. They said, ""We all care for you, we know how you suffer, But I know you can succeed, I used to have it so much rougher."" There's hope in the words and emotion in the eyes. It's so easy to be misled by the savvy gentle guise And like fools we trust the delivery, But it's all just drunk sincerity. In maternal family assembly poised regarding the blue tube, The numbers crept up higher and the hawks stayed out of view. Then the generals said, ""We dont want our boys dead. Your sons and your husbands will be coming back heroes soon."" There's hope in the words and emotion in the eyes. It's so easy to be misled by the savvy gentle guise And like fools we trust the delivery, But it's all just drunk sincerity. With steam, heat, and rhythm in the back seat of the car And adolescent perspective projecting life's forecast to the stars, You heard love from the lips and you were rapt by the hips And the promise was eternal, but you couldn't see that far. There's hope in the words and emotion in the eyes. It's so easy to be misled by the savvy gentle guise And like fools we trust the delivery, But it's all just drunk sincerity.        "
60,"         Weak and sick, dying in the sand, no such thing as a promised land.  Don't lose faith in a better life--reincarnation, poor excuse. You're dying you asshole, your religion can't help you now. Dying and starving in the fields you used to plow. Rotting bones in your barren fields.  Worshipped creature's supposed to heal. He won't save you and he won't save me.  See what you want to see. Hindu religion in the mind of a working Joe, Starving and dying in the fields you used to know. You're tied and bound to a god's useless advice. Bloated stomachs from aching diseases hold back the fight. In the end you'll return once more to die again. Go on till you can't no more in non-eternal sin.        "
61,"         Everwhere you looked there was confusion, violence, drama and drugs, So many righteous revolutionaries spouting utopian love, Everyone shrouded in purple haze, Then one day they woke up from their dream state. They found themselves no more at peace than before, Older, meek, and conformed. Empty causes, A bluster for the soul, a fix for their mind. Empty causes, Cling to everything you find. Well, the shots rang out like popcorn And the Chief was hit and rushed out of sight, The mohawk-chain leather brigade rejoiced maliciously on that night. Someone cried out ""fuck the government"", His mates couldn't define what he meant So no one gave him the time of day And the scene died away. Empty causes, A war for the body, an army in the mind. Empty causes, Losing steam as time goes by. Could it be that everybody selfishly desires their own personal retinue And that causes are just manifestations Of too much time and far too little to do. Empty causes, Direction for the soul, conviction for the mind. Empty causes, Cling to everything you find. Empty causes, You've got yours and I've got mine.        "

Entropy, energy at all levels, Entropy, from it you can not divorce. And your pathetic moans of suffrage tend to lose all significance. Extinction, degradation: The natural outcomes of our ordered lives. Power, motivation: Temporary fixtures for which we strive.

Entropy, energy at all levels, Entropy, from it you can not divorce.

What's right is wrong, What's come has gone, What's clear and pure is not so sure.(It came to me.) All promises become a lie, All that's benign corrupts in time,(The fallacy) Of Epiphany.

If your soul needs love, you can get consoled by pity, But it looks as though faith alone won't sustain us no more. Watched the scientists throw up their hands conceding, ""Progress will resolve it all."" Saw the manufacturers of Earth's debris ignore another Green Peace call.

Hey, can you tell me how does it feel? Yeah, tell me... Can you imagine, for a second, Doing anything that you don't have to? Well that's what I'm accustomed to so hooray for me... And fuck you! When I slept with stony faces on the riverbank, My angeldevil reveler shook me desperately in dying. I don't exactly want to apologize for anything.  And now we're all mad and tangled in secret rooms  With roman candles on an endless graveyard train. Yeah, tell me... Can you imagine, for a second,  Doing anything just 'cus you want to? Well, that's just what I do so hooray for me... And fuck you! Yeah, I was dreaming through the ""howzlife"", yawning, car black,  When she told me ""mad and meaningless as ever.."" And a song came on my radio like a cemetery rhyme For a million crying corpses in their tragedy of respectable existence. Yeah, tell me... Can you imagine, for a second,  Trying half the things you ever wanted to? Well, that's just what I do, so hooray for me... And fuck you! Oh yeah... I'm not respectable, and never sensible, I've been incredible, so damned irascible And I like the things I do so hooray for me... And fuck you!        "
91,"         Tell me can the hateful chain be broken? Production and consumption define our hollow lives.Avarice has led us 'cross the ocean, Toward a land that's better, much more bountiful and wide. So when will mankind finally come to realize His surfeit has become his demise? How much is enough to kill yourself? That quantity is known today, as we blow ourselves away. Tell me is there anything so sure?Rapacity, tenacity, capacity for more! Like a dog that feeds until he suffers,Infirmity of man is brought on by his selfish cure. When will mankind finally come to realize His surfeit has become his demise? How much is enough to kill yourself? That quantity is known today, as we blow ourselves away.        "
92,"         I love my computer, You make me feel alright Every waking hour And every lonely night. I love my computer For all you give to me: Predictable errors  And no identity. And it's never been quite so easy, I've never been quite so happy. All I need to do is click on you And we'll be joined in the most soulless way, And we'll never ruin each other's day 'Cause when I'm through I just click And you just go away. I love my computer, You're always in the mood. I get so turned on When I turn on you. I love my computer, You never ask for more. You can be a princess Or you can be my whore. And it's never been quite so easy, I've never been quite so happy. All I need to do is click on you And we'll be joined in the most soulless way, And we'll never ruin each other's day 'Cause when I'm through I just click And you just go away. The world outside is so big, But it's safe in my domain Because to you I'm just a number And a clever screen name. All I need to do is click on you And we'll be together for eternity. And no one is ever gonna take my love from me  Because I've got security, her password and a key.        "
93,"         Going through a world of sad debris, Regard quixotic reveries of ownership: The blossoming disease of man called tenure and accretion, The ancient western treadmill of deception and derision. But I want something more. Racing through a life of tragic wastage, I experience the loss of trust and innocence. The billowing cyclone of time has blown away our reasons As we trudge like blind men forward trying to avoid collision. But I want something... More.        "

96,"         I can see the shadows on the wall Drifting as the leaves start to fall. Unfazed by rugosity, the objects yield to gravity And depict the destiny of us all. No one really knows why we die. No one gets a break so we try. Ignoring mortality, we worship mediocrity And wait to see what happens up on high. In so many ways we live to follow the sun, In so many ways we exalt and fail as one. In so many ways we want so bad to be done, In so many ways we show our pain in unison. Something in you is busy counting the days, Catapulting you through the haze. Blind to virtuosity, ignorant of your sanctity, Revealing you, in so many ways. In so many ways we live to follow the sun, In so many ways we tend to rise and fall as one. In so many ways we want so bad to be done, In so many ways we show our pain in unison.        "

In the night, in the night you see through jaded eyes. In the night, in the night you feel barely alive. You live your life in darkness, you've got pennies on your eyes. But you say that it's all right, 'cuz you've never lived a lie, As you crawl back to your womblike existence in the night. In the night, in the night you see through jaded eyes. In the night, in the night you feel barely alive. You can't see no light, but you hear those heavy footsteps, And the little man inside twists your tormented mind. Your mind is filled with shadows, your palms are wet with sweat. Limbs are bound and tangled in a fatal net. There are two things you can do. One is turn and fight. The other's run headlong into the night. In the night, in the night you see through jaded eyes. In the night, in the night you feel barely alive. You can't see no light, but you hear those heavy footsteps, And the breathing at your side, is it yours or is it Good bye!        "
98,         There's something pathetic in the world today And I don't know how it all began As if all the shame and punishment will finally make me understand A word means nothing wanting action Intentions are valuable as deeds And a wound can dog you for a lifetime Unless it only makes you bleed Everybody knows what's in their heart is right I'm just a termite on an ant hill I think about it every single day A senseless being lacking inspiration Just waiting to be blown away Everybody knows what's in their heart is right

I don't ask questions, don't promote demonstrations, Don't look for new consensus, don't stray from constitution. If I pierce the complexity I won't find salvation, Just the bald and overt truth of the evil and deception. There is an inner logic, and we're taught to stay far from it. It is simple and elegant, but it's cruel and antithetic And there's no effort to reveal it. Graduated mentors stroll in marbled brick porticos In sagacious dialog they despise their average ways, Betraying pomp and discipline, they mold their institution Where they practice exclusion on the masses every day.

And it must look pretty appealing, The acres of lights, The crowded festive nights And the millions of others just like you. Yeah it must look pretty appealing, This other world of sin. We keep dreaming of what other people do. The person sitting next to you is dismal and deranged On the bus ride home from work to end your day. And the food on your table is more plastic than protein, And your intellect depends on your TV. And it must look pretty appealing The pastoral retreat, The folks on old Main Street, And the few pleasant people just like you. Yeah it must look pretty appealing, The simple way of life.

Wo-oh oh oh oh oh. It's a long way to the promise land, If we work we might find it here. There's no substitute for enlightenment, There's no reason for bridled fear.

The media parading, disjointed politics Founded on petrochemical plunder, And we're its hostages. If you stand to reason, you're in the game, The rules might be elusive, but our pieces are the same. And you know if one goes down we all go down as well, The balance is precarious as anyone can tell, This world's going to hell. Don't allow This mythologic hopeful monster to exact its price. Kyoto now! We can't do nothing and think someone else will make it right. You might not think it matters now, but what if you are wrong? You might not think there's any wisdom in a fucked up punk rock song. But the way it is cannot persist for long, A brutal sun is rising on a sick horizon. It's in the way we live our lives, Exactly like the double-edge of a cold familiar knife. And supremacy weighs heavy on the day, It's never really what you own, but what you threw away. And how much did you pay? Don't allow This mythologic hopeful monster to exact its price. Kyoto now! We can't do nothing and think someone else will make it right. In your dreams You saw a steady state a bounty for eternity. Silent screams But now the wisdom that sustained us is in full retreat. Don't allow This mythologic hopeful monster isn't worth the risk. Kyoto now! We can't have vision for the future if it can't be fixed. Alien We need a fresh and new religion to run our lives. Hand in hand The arid torpor of inaction will be our demise.

112,"         There's the image of a man Who commands a high opinion, And he hides his hatred with a sheepish grin. And beside him flanking closely Are the boisterous hollow masses Who lap up whatever trickles in. This intercourse of nature, This vulgar social pastime Reflects the lowest mark of our progress. And the few who ride peripheral Maintain subtle advantage, Fighting hard to abstain and redress. Do you know your place In the big charade? Are you more than they? Leaders and followers... [4x] Recognition by proximity and a brand new face, Just a smidgen of success pie and a pinch of social grace; You can play with the big boys or you can tell them what to do, But sooner or later there's another one like you.

There's hate and opposition, There's fumbling dialog, Yet you sit there and judge me And you think it makes a difference. If you think I'm all alone, you are foolishly wrong, There's an entire army who blindly follows along. And you happen to be one of them, believe it or not, Even though you try not to be, we are of the same plague. The other ways we're taught to fear, Don't even scratch the surface of the problem here. I'm not blind, and I'm not scared, So many crucial factors exist out there, And we're but one, and they're but two, And how we come to terms will help us pull through. Things cannot change too fast, it took us this much time To reach our current platform and walk this fragile line. If I thought I'd make a difference, I'd kill myself today, But so many are like me lost in the fray. You create your own reality, And leave mine to me...        "

All your darkest fears Are just a vestige of regret. And it's wo-oh oh oh, It seems like such a long way to go. As obstacles get bigger,Prevailing winds blow stronger And the fire continues to grow Don't let shallow water  Limit your perception.Heed the new horizon,Muster to it fast. The moments of your yesterdays Are in the wake behind you. You can't assess the future If you're living in the past. Keep it stoked! If you are committed To a life of understanding, Then there's no agenda For vengeance in your life. Sharpen all your senses, Face the opposition. You can overcome With fortitude and mental might.

Let them eat war, [x2] There's an urgent need to feed Declining pride. From the force to the union shops The war economy is making new jobs, But the people who benefit most Are breaking bread with their benevolent host.

Let them eat war, [x2] There's an urgent need to feed Declining pride. Kill 'em and eat 'em before they reach for their checks. Squeeze some blue collars, make 'em bleed from their necks.

116,"         The road is narrow, the horizon wide And they say what's waiting on the other side  Is so rewarding and the ultimate prize, But what good is something if you can't have it until you die? Desperate, tenacious, clinging like a grain of sand, Watching its foundation wash away. Drunk with the assertions they know they can't defend, Confident that they might live again. Live again! Live again! Would you give it all up to live again? Live again! Live again! Would you give it all up to live again? Temptation, revelation, you decide, Torture shows its colors often in disguise. Progress and purpose help us realize We pass along a brighter faith even though it must be blind. Desperate, tenacious, clinging like a grain of sand, Watching its foundation wash away. Drunk with the assertions they know they can't defend, Confident that they might live again. Live again! Live again! Would you give it all up to live again? Live again! Live again!

117,"         Suddenly, it came to me, A potent dosage of reality, I saw myself in the broad daylight And it made me think about life. I'm not the kind of guy  Who nods his head with closed eyes, I scoff at labels, I defy censuses  And despise group mentality. All along I thought that this was only human, But I know now that I'm in the minority. I'm lookin' in... Now I think in relation to My fellow man and what he strives to do, We fail to see, there's no compromise, Our evolution is our demise. One day you may find that you are also one of me, A complex microcosm of the human race, Observing those around us, desiring to belong, Behind the guise of salvation we suffer along the way. We're lookin' in...        "

And you can’t deny that living is easy If you never look behind the scenery, It's showtime for dry climes And bedlam is dreaming of rain. When the hills of Los Angeles are burning, Palm trees are candles in the murder wind, So many lives on the breeze, Even the stars are ill at ease And Los Angeles is burning. This is not a test Of the emergency broadcast system When Malibu fires and radio towers Conspire to dance again. And I cannot believe the media Mecca, They're only trying to peddle reality: Catch it on prime time, story at nine, The whole world is going insane. When the hills of Los Angeles are burning, Palm trees are candles in the murder wind, So many lives on the breeze, Even the stars are ill at ease And Los Angeles is burning. A placard reads: ""The end of days"". Jacaranda boughs are bending in the haze. More a question than a curse, How could hell be any worse? The flames are stunning, The camera's running So take warning. When the hills of Los Angeles are burning, Palm trees are candles in the murder wind, So many lives on the breeze, Even the stars are ill at ease And Los Angeles is burning.        "

The jungle was once a tranquil hideaway For the kind of trees and the mountains themselves. But man those things sell a million dollars a pound, Cut them up, dry them out, good display for the shelves. Why can't we just leave them alone? Who is the animal? Who is that dangerous beast? Why were the other ones made? I know it wasn't just for our feast. And now they're down to 250 lone souls, They're a breed of a losing generation, it seems. The killers are ourselves so you know who to blame, It was man with his plan and his frightening greed. I don't think we'll ever leave them alone.  Who is the animal? Who is that dangerous beast? Why were the other ones made? I know it wasn't just for our feast.        "
121,"         Pilgrim, those are dry and bitter tears and lonely Eyes that look way beyond your years Pilgrim, did you drink the mercury? Your lips turned blue and you're struggling just to see, You were too far gone to carry on, now your life has stalled, As you march ahead yet go no place at all.. Pilgrim, when you left them all behind The loneliness destroyed your able mind, Pilgrim, see the writing on the door?  It's taking you back to a place you were before And the next in line paces your stride waiting for your fall, With a hope that lies in a hidden master's callPious eyes ignoring passers by Headlong to their grave Don't despair this world of toil and care. This pilgrim lost his way Pilgrim, will you ever find your call? Is truth so pure that you're willing to risk it all?

Somebody out there must be reading my mail 'Cause everybody knows... Follow me when you give up, Work for me, it'll serve you well. Everyone is a hypocrite, Come to me, I'll save your soul.

123,"         If I'm a monster, I am a willing one, This roller coaster ride is an enticing one, On the tip of a continuum flowing wavelike Through disorder carry me like a vessel to water. Everything you see leaves a mark on your soul, Everything you feel leaves a mark on your soul, Everything you touch leaves a mark on your soul, Everything you make leaves a mark on your soul. If I can touch it, I can destroy it, If it's imaginable to some degree, I can become it, Like a hungry turning vortex that just flickers to existence, Consuming bits and pieces until I'm finally extinguished. Everyone you see leaves a mark on your soul, Everyone you bare leaves a mark on your soul, Everyone you touch leaves a mark on your soul, Everyone you love leaves a mark on your soul. Everything you take leaves a mark on your soul, Everything you give leaves a mark on your soul, And all the fear and loneliness that's impossible to control And every tear you cry leaves a mark on your soul.

124,"         You will all say  That I am surely crazy , Only an unrepentant pessimist  Whose thoughts should be detained. But facts are sterile,  Not vulgar nor sublime, And they're not religion, They're for everyone And signify the times. Today is a window,  Tomorrow the landscape. All you need to do is take a look outside To know what we're bound to face. The level of disparity, the common man, The manner of destruction of the native land, The poverty of reprisal from all involved And the scathing trajectory from the past.Markovian process, Lead us not in vain. Prove to our descendants what we did to them, Then make us go away.        "

I want to believe in you, but my plan keeps falling through, I know I have to face the harshness, grin and bear the truth, And I have to walk this mile in my own shoes.(But I'm no fool!) I'm materialist, A full-blown realist, (Physical theorist) And I guess I'm full of doubt, So I'm prone to have it out with you. I'm materialist, There ain't no fear in this, It's there for all to see, so don't talk of hidden mystery with me... Mind over matter, it really don't matter If the street's idle chatter turns your heart strings to tatters. Flatter hopes don't flatter and soul batter won't congeal to mend A life that is shattered into shards. Was it in the cards? The process of belief is an elixir when you're weak, I must confess, at times I indulge it on the sneak, But generally my outlook's not so bleak.(And I'm not meek!)  I'm materialist, Call me a humanist, And I guess I'm full of doubt, So I'm prone to have it out with you. I'm materialist, There ain't no fear in this, It's for all to see, so don't talk of hidden mysteries with me... Like Rome under Nero, our future's one big zero, Recycling the past to meet immediate needs. And through it all we amble forth and persevere and climb Our mountains of regrets to sow our seeds! I'm materialist, I'm materialist, I'm materialist, I'm materialist. (hold)        "
126,"         Look around the country, an abundance you'll find of Mediocre minds. Sift trough the fodder as the sane justice declines because of Mediocre minds. Shrouded under cover, the most flamboyant guise hides a Mediocre mind. You got yours, but you can never bend mine with your Mediocre minds. When they cry foul, you had better watch out  Because you never know which aptitude they're griping about. Don't act too smart for their stenoscopic ways. You'll be discarded away. Reason's not to be what the privileged define with their Mediocre minds. So many sighted people act so helplessly blind from their Mediocre minds. If you want attention, then you will be asked to bend, But the surest insurrection is enlightenment, Then you can live outside inharmoniously without friends and enemies. They wanna keep me locked away 'Cause I'm an overactive brain. Leaders, presidents and the nightly news guys cater to Mediocre minds. Reason's not to be what the privileged define with their Mediocre minds. You got yours, but you can never bend mine with your Mediocre minds.

127,"         I've spent my life observing and then pondering this place And never has confusion ever ceased. I've also heard a lot of exaltation for our kind And sanctimonious reverence for peace. The stories from our childhood condition us to think That beauty is a basic human trait. But how are they reconciled with daily realities Like poverty and dominance and rape? But you have to be Stone cold dead not to see Overwhelming incongruity, As we search for suggestions to remedy...Mediocrity. [3x] If you just sit back and record what you see, The tragic and exquisite are the same to some degree. But most events depict a common theme: There's far more disorder than there is harmony.

128,"         In 325, the Council devised a set of sacred testaments, transparent and wise. The truth is only ever relied on that which we agree and abide. At the meeting of the minds. Reading of the times. Open the blinds. To our complicated lives. We all need some kind of creed to lead us to light. In old Tennessee, the last century. All scopes were fixed on legal tricks and whether or not we should teach kids natural philosophy, despite uncomfortable verity. At the meeting of the minds. Reading of the times. Open the blinds. To our complicated lives. We all need some kind of creed to lead us to light. There's a beacon that shines in the night, a dark pitch though it may be. And the halcyon fields of opportunity turn out to be consensual and arbitrary. Today on my ride I witnessed a guy complaining about how a so-and-so had lied. No longer will the market decide what the government should provide. At the meeting of the minds. Reading of the times. Open the blinds. To our complicated lives. We all need some kind of creed to lead us to light.        "

The terse, oppressive blanket that's instilled here by our spin. It's misery and famine, it's a force we cannot see, Misery and famine, it compels us naturally. Misery and famine, great ellipse, we bend to thee, misery and famine, just accept your vagrancy. Others who bear no name, who feel that life's a game, My verse they will defame, we suffer all the same. They pay no regard to their position or their speed, But the firmament still covers them with its malevolent seed. It's misery and famine, it's a force we cannot see, Misery and famine, it compels us naturally. Misery and famine, great ellipse, we bend to thee, Misery and famine, just accept your vagrancy. You look for meaning in things no one comprehends, You feel no affinity to the rabble we're in, Sources of inquiry have nothing to portend, They will perplex us all until the coming end, until the coming end. A feeling of despair, hungry and full of care, We resent everywhere the fortune that we share. ""This earth could be a better place"" is a concept I condone, Given our pathetic course our destiny is known. It's misery and famine, it's a force we cannot see, Misery and famine, it compels us naturally. Misery and famine, great ellipse, we bend to thee, Misery and famine, just accept your vagrancy. Misery and famine, Misery and famine, Misery and famine, Misery and famine.        "

There's no vestige of a beginning, no prospect of an end. When we all disintegrate it will all happen again, yeah.

He left his people and a simple life behind, He raised his torso and looked into the sky, Shouting his questions, looking for directions. ""What do I do now?"" Now a confused schoolgirl stares at the TV tray, The stresses of maturing compound every day. She glances up to see her favorite video And gets ideas from Madonna's nasty clothes. In need of affection, she craves a direction Her heroes offer her. Everyone's looking for something And they assume somebody else knows what it is. No one can live with the decisions of their own. It seems so they look to someone else To tell them what to do, Tell 'em what to wear, Tell 'em what to say, Tell 'em how to act and think And compel others compulsively  Until the world is all like them. A righteous student came and asked me to reflect, He judged my lifestyle was politically incorrect.

Once you convince yourself, The universe falls into place. You've got your ideas And your posse of friends, You all make up rules And the fun never ends. But still there's a problem that leaves you gasping for air, You look for some meaning, blank smiles are all that's there, And still water stales a soft summer breeze, You cling to your hopes while you drop to your knees. There's no substance. Once you convince yourself, The universe falls into place. You've got your ideas And your posse of friends, You all make up rules And the fun never ends.

Sitting on the fence post to watch the storm roll in And terrified of the damage it will bring when it begins. It will begin... Splintered dreams of unity, (Our lives are parallel) So far from reality, (Our lives are parallel) Independent trajectories, (Our lives are parallel) Separate terms of equality. (Our lives are parallel) Our lives are parallel... Is there no redemption? No common good? Is there nothing we can do for ourselves or only what we should? Comes the hard admission of what we don't provide Goes the insistence on the ways and means that so divide. They so divide...

153,"         The final page is written in the books of history, As man unleashed his deadly bombs and sent troops overseas To fight a war which can't be won and kills the human race, A show of greed and ignorance, man's quest for dominance. They say when a mistake is made, a lesson has been learned. But this time, there's no turning back, the hate engulfs the world. A million lives are lost each day, a city slowly burns, A mother holds her dying child, but no one is concerned!        "

And immortality is in our mastermind, And we destroy everything we can find. And tomorrow when the human clock stops and the world stops ticking, We'll be an index fossil buried in our own debris. We're listless, promiscuous, And life to us is either hit or miss, oh yeah. We're savoir faire and debonaire And things we do are done with pride and care, oh yeah.

The dominant portion seek an instant gratification And are proud of intellectual poverty I'd like to be empathetic but I can't The jeopardy is too great to make a stand Now the past is dead Good deeds won't help you get ahead The modern signpost read the past is dead My next great decision is just lying in wait The action might turn out to be the world's most grievous mistake The past is dead More veritable words have never been said The tragic present said the past is dead          "

Pity, pity, on the masses of aggression. Pity, pity, on the future centuries to come, On the billions of ignorant people, On the future centuries to come, On the masses of aggression.

Why do we pity the dead? Are you churned by emotion from voices in your head? Look at all the living and you'll ask yourself why, Oh, why do we pity the dead? Pity the dead! Well, you've seen the disease, suffering and decay, And you whisper to yourself blissfully ""it's okay"" And you still refuse the possibility That the dead are better off than we. Why do we pity the dead? Are you scared of the logic that swirls within your head? Look at all the living and you'll ask yourself why, Oh, why do we pity the dead? Pity the dead! Tell me what you see, tell me what you know. Is there anyone who lives a painless life? If there is show me so. The destitute and famished,  Demonic and the banished,  Dejected and the ostracized,  The brainwashed and the paralyzed,  The conquered and objectified,  The few who see the other side, Tell me what you see!

You're lucky if they listen to a single word you say. What is right, what is wrong, the government decides. You don't have no rights at all, as long as you don't fight. We're all being oppressed by the upper middle class. The government you vote for is the one that you put there. I'm so tired and now I'm through and so are you.

So before you go to contribute more To the destruction of this world you adore, Remember life on Earth is but a flash of dawn We're all part of it as the day rolls on. And progress is a message that we send. One step closer to the future, one inch closer to the end. I say that progress is a synonym of time. We are all aware of it but it's nothing we refine. And progress is a debt we all must pay. Its convenience we all cherish, its pollution we disdain. And the cutting edge is dulling, Too many people to plow through. Just keep your fucking distance And it can't include you. It's progress, 'til there's nothing left to gain,  It's progress, it's a message that we send. And progress is a debt we all must pay.

She could never meet their expectations, Then she came to symbolize the nation.

I know why it tore down that day, You thought that if you got caught, We'd all go away. Like a spoiled little baby Who can't come out to play, You had your revenge. Build me up, tear me down Like a skyscraper, Build me up, then tear down These joining walls, So they can't climb at all. Well, madness reigned And paradise drowned, When Babel's walls came crashing down, Now the echoes roar For a story writ That was hardly understood And never any good. Build me up, tear me down Like a skyscraper, Build me up, then tear down These joining walls, So they can't climb at all.        "
182,"         Congress runs your daily life, but they brainwash you so you think it's freedom We've had a war every 20 years,  they make you think we really need 'em We're all slaves for our stricter masters We're all slaves for our stricter masters We're all just slaves for our stricter masters We're slaves You're brought up thinking it's bad to live  in any country except this one And when you grow into a man  you realize it ain't too much fun We're in a country of democracy, it's supposed to be the best on the globe Living's expensive and it ain't too fun  unless you form a high-class mode And we're all just slaves for ournstricter masters We're all slaves for our stricter masters We're all slaves for our stricter masters We're slaves And we're all just slaves for our stricter masters, we're slaves!          "
183,"         So, you're feeling unimportant 'Cause you've got nothing to say. And your live is just a ramble, No one understands you anyway. Well, I've got a piece of news, son That might make you change your mind. Your life is historically meaningful And spans a significant time.Slumber will come soon And you are helping put it to sleep. Side by side we do our share, Faithfully assuring that Slumber will come soon. Well, now do you feel a little better? Lift up your head and walk away, Knowing we're all in this together For such a short time anyway. There is just no time to parade around sulking, I would rather laugh than cry. The rich, the poor, the strong, the weak: We share this place together And we pitch in to help it die. I'm not too good at giving morals And I don't fear the consequence. If life makes you scared and bitter, At least it's not for very long. Slumber will come soon And you are helping put it to sleep. Side by side we do our share, Faithfully assuring that Slumber will come soon. [4x]        "
184,"         Right now! Well, it’s finally time to face my fears, Gonna get the hell out of here And create a fresher atmosphere, But the consequence is clear. There’s a furnace set on high And a yearning undefined, But it's time to turn the tide, It’s social suicide. Like you! Perseverance is a useless tool, Just a patron on a ship of fools, Feigning interest in the cast and crew While you’ve broken every single rule. There’s a furnace set on high And a yearning undefined, Now it’s time to turn the tide, It’s social suicide. Shadows entertain the unwashed masses, Scholars explain their numb reactions. I don’t even know if I can ever find truth, But I’m sure it won’t come from following you. There’s a furnace set on high And a yearning undefined, But it’s time to turn the tide, It’s social suicide.        "
185,"         Dark, frozen, hibernation held at bay as your mind, left behind, lost another day. But finally there’s someone to believe. Anti-social boredom is all the rage but the time comes when you gotta turn the page and then finally there’s someone to believe. And now you walk with confidence and ease. And there’s no call to sell your soul or confess or drop down to your knees. Who, what, or where made you change your mind? Doesn’t matter anymore ‘cuz you’ve seen a sign. And now finally there’s someone to believe. Searching for the answer’s a lonely quest but the act is liable to bring out your best. And then finally there’s someone to believe. And now you have a purpose to perceive. And you find out the baggage that you discarded, you didn’t even need. No one can deny a return to form irrespective of the morass, shame, and scorn. But then finally there’s someone to believe. Ready to emerge and direct your fate as the self-determination radiates because finally there’s someone to believe. And now you walk with confidence and ease And it feels like the spring equinox after a long winter’s sleep. Finally, there’s someone to believe.          "
186,"         There's a specter in the corner of an illustrated page And a lonesome muted stripling with a rapt remedial gaze. The poverty of his language and the wealth of his emotion Bring him endless murky musings and unexpected frustration. Angst and madness weave the fabric of his life. Tomorrow might be better but right now it feels like...  There's a panther wild and proud behind the doors of a redolent cage, And an underdeveloped intellect filled with impotent and static rage. And don't think you're exempt if you earn good weekly wages, 'Cause your neighbor's going crazy and insanity's contagious. I know there's so much you want to say, But your tongue gets in the way and sometimes it feels like...  I know there's so much you want to say And the tumbrel of your mind gets in the way. It's the same for everybody to degrees. We all get that foggy freeze and sometimes it feels like... "
187,"         Father, can you hear me?  How have I let you down?  I curse the day that I was born  And all the sorrow in this world. Let me take you to the herding ground Where all good men are trampled down, Just to settle a bet that could not be won  Between a prideful father and his son. Will you guide me now, for I can't see A reason for the suffering and this long misery. What if every living soul could be upright and strong? Well, then I do imagine...  There will be sorrow, Yeah, there will be sorrow, And there will be sorrow no more. When all soldiers lay their weapons down Or when all kings and all queens relinquish their crowns  Or when the only true messiah rescues us from ourselves. It's easy to imagine  There will be sorrow, Yeah, there will be sorrow, And there will be sorrow no more. There will be sorrow, And there will be sorrow, And there will be sorrow no more. Yeah there will be sorrow, Yeah there will be sorrow, And there will be sorrow no more.        "
188,"         We all know politicians only go Just halfway there,  Just halfway there. The innocence of youth needs protection not abuse But no one seems to care,  Yet no one seems to care. And you sit there and watch the world go around From your pseudo-benevolent vantage point, While we who've been left to pick up after you Try our best to make some sense for those who Come next. Now what have you done to foster the truth Besides just hide the lies? Besides just hide the lies? A selfish campaign never justifies the gain, But the means are verified, Yeah, the means are verified. And you sit there and insist you are right From your popular psychological podium, While those who rely and depend on you, They wilt because you don't accept we need Each other. While sowing the seeds of Utopia, You invoked a convenient amnesia. You forgot how to care, you forgot how to provide, You forgot how to work towards a meaningful life.        "
189,"         Shed a tear for the criminal,  Give him something to believe. Light a fire for the miserable,  Give the darkness some meaning. Closed wounds harbor pestilence When you lick them from within, Charity has a redolence, Chastity cannot rescind. Spirit shine, it's a sign Of a troubled mind. (tortured mind) Spirit shine all the time Can render you blind. You can take it all to heart or throw it all away. You can call it just a lark or live your life that way. You can give until you're dry and sucked of all your gleam. You can fake another cry and compromise your dream. Spirit shine, it's a sign Of a tortured mind. Spirit shine all the time Can render you blind. Cling tight to the parable, Let it dominate your life. Create a God who's infallible, Give your leader some respite. Closed wounds harbor pestilence When you lick them from within, Rosy smiles lose their radiance When you take it on the chin. Spirit shine, it's a sign Of a tortured mind. Spirit shine all the time Can render you blind.        "
190,"         This weekend I will spend over 800 million dollars on drugs. First, I will continue pushing free narcotics for all low income people not now covered and soon after that, we can get rid of each and every one of them. And I'm doing what I think is right, and they will certainly deserve it.        "
191,"         A mutinous enemy Carved a nascent country. Sweat, blood and valor Forms the grit of our history. Bequeathed to everyone: Chance and free expression, Substance was restrained And the spirit was broken. I feel a strange denial, Rhythmic as a change, Constant as time. Lonely insistent whispers, Somber as a wave bye bye. Searching for solution Without constitution, Black coats by our sides Promising salvation. Advocating dogma As tickets to hereafter, Mortals in their prime With their desperate hands in the air. Daunting, complex and burning, Rhythmic as change, Constant as time. Conflicts craving approval Weighted as a murder trial. Oh, I feel a strange denial. Correct is consensus, Everything else nonsense. Forward is the hope, Forget recompense. Peace and tranquility Is only for the wealthy,Dearth for the masses And inequality. I feel a strange denial, Rhythmic as change, Constant as time. Lonely insistent whispers, Dissipating in the night Like a lone forgotten light. And no one is helping me, It's a strange denial.        "
192,"         A febrile shocking violent smack And the children are hoping for a heart attack. Tonight the windows are watching, the streets all conspire, And the lamppost can't stop crying. If I could fly high above the world, Would I see a bunch of living dots spell the world stupidity? Or would I just see hungry lover homicides, loving brother suicides, And olly olly oxenfrees who pickaside and hide? The world is scratching at my door, My morning paper's got the scores, The human interest stories and the obituary. Cockroach naps and rattling traps, How many devils can you fit upon a match head? Caringosity killed the Kerouac cat, Sometimes truth is stranger than fiction. In my alley around the corner, There's a wino with feathered shoulders, And a spirit giving head for crack and he'll never want it back. There's a little kid and his family eating crackers like Thanksgiving And a pack of wild desperadoes scornful of living. The world is scratching at my door, My morning paper has the scores, The human interest stories and the obituary. Cradle for a cat, Wolfe looks back, How many angels can you fit upon a match? I want to know why Hemingway cracked, Sometimes truth is stranger than fiction. Life is the crummiest book I ever read, There isn't a hook, just a lot of cheap shots, Pictures to shock and characters an amateur would never dream up. Sometimes truth is stranger than fiction...        "
193,"         There's an old man on a city bus Holding a candy cane And it isn't even christmas. He sees a note in the obituary  That his last friend has died. There's an infant clinging to  His overweight mother in the cold As they go to shop for cigarettes, And she spends her last dollar On a bottle of vodka for tonight. And I guess it struck a nerve, Like I had to squint my eyes, You can never get out of the line of sight. Like a barren winter day Or a patch of unburned green, Like a tragic real dream, I guess it struck a nerve. Every day I wander in negative disposition As I'm bombarded by superlatives, Realizing very well that I'm not alone.Introverted, I look to tomorrow for salvation, But I'm thinking altruistically And a wave of overwhelming doubt Turns me to stone. And I guess it struck a nerve, Sent a murmur through my heart, We just haven't got time to crack the maze. Like a magic speeding clock Or a cancer in our cells, A collision in the dark, I guess it struck a nerve. I try to close my eyes, But I cannot ignore the stimuli. If there's a purpose for us all, It remains a secret to me, Don't ask me to justify my life. And I guess it struck a nerve, Like I had to squint my eyes, You can never get out of the line of sight.

An unturned stone, an undiscovered Door leading to the gift of hope renewed, eternity for you. The masses of humanity have always had to suffer. The businessman whose master plan controls the world each day Is blind to indications of his species' slow decay. Can't you see his life is just like yours?

When I need to sate, I just accelerate Into oblivion. Into oblivion yah yah yah yah yah yah ya-ahn...

The world outside is buzzing like an angry wasp in summer, The candidates are running, and soon the son of God is coming, Crackle mental convolutions tune in to the revolution, Whereby everyone's included so we'll never have to be alone. Every atom of my body, blood and sinew, bone and fibre, I can't distil you from my blood, You're a hungry germ inside of me. You're my lover, you're my heroine, My conscience and my voice, And I know now that I have learned to let you in I will never have to be alone. I'd take after my mother but she's from a different generation, I prefer my big brother, he's so gentle and understanding, And I learn what I can from him by the television light, So that when I'm all alone, I know everything's gonna be alright.

200,"         Long ago in a dusty village Full of hunger, pain and strife, A man came forth with a vision of truth And the way to a better life. He was convinced he had the answer And he compelled people to follow along, But the hunger never vanished And the man was banished And the village dried up and died. At a time when wise men peered Through glass tubes toward the sky, The heavens changed in predictable ways And one man was able to find, That he had thought he found the answer And he was quick to write his revelation, But as they were scrutinized In his colleagues eyes, He soon became a mockery. Don't tell me about the answer 'cause then another one will come along soon. I don't believe you have the answer, I've got ideas, too. But if you've got enough naivete, And you've got conviction, Then the answer is perfect for you. An urban sprawl sits choking on its discharge Overwhelmed by industry, Searching for a modern day  Savior from another placeInclined toward charity. Everyone's begging for an answer Without regard to validity, The searching never ends, It goes on and on and on for eternity. Don't tell me about the answer 'cause then another one will come along soon. I don't believe you have the answer, I've got ideas, too.

But stealthily, in the land of the free, it's lurking right there: Most are unaware of The biggest killer in American history, And God shed his grace on thee. Business institutions, universities, Both are quite the circus where the killer wants his way. I think of Edward Teller and his moribund reprise, Then I look to Nevada and I can't believe my eyes. It's time for him to die! Most cannot remember minutia learned in school. It's not there on the blackboard, it's what they don't tell you. We have got a problem, it starts and ends right here. It can be defeated, but you've got to face your fear. We'll join and unite and steady our sight, Then we'll put it right 'cause it's time to fight The biggest killer in American history, And God shed his grace on thee.        "

Do you remember when you marred my future with a sickly parasitic pall? That was the day that the earth stalled. That was the day the earth stalled. On the day that the earth stalled. Friction, bonds, and gravity, all harmonic motion ceased. Life itself could not maintain from that singularity. Try to withstand a magnetic storm with no one to keep you warm.

This is the way of the modern world, Everyone's fighting for dominance, This is the way of the modern world, And something has gotta give. Now I believe in unity, and I am willing to compromise, But I'm not gonna lie or sell my soul. Every time you shake someone's hand, It determines where you stand, And if you won't uphold your side then it's better to Fend for yourself, and shun the handshake, Someone's gotta give.        "
212,"         Our Apocalypse 1981, Teenage vagrants lookin' for some fun. A renewed promise of prosperity, A vulgar platform for the world to see. We were... The hippy killers! [4x] Busted refuse from broken homes, Pocked flesh and malacious bones, Creatures sustained by desire, heart and soul, Nothing to leave and nowhere to go. We were... The hippy killers! [4x] Good days during horrible times, Overused bodies, neglected minds, Shoulder to shoulder we formed as one, The next miserable generation. We were... The hippy killers! [4x]        "
213,"         Oh me oh my... Get out of your 1950's fantasy, Your face shines with misery transparently. Spew out that sobering Half-assed victim rhetoric, Make 'em all squirm While they chew on it. It's a secret handshake And a passing wink of the eye As the witches bridge club weekly Meets to pen the tail on the sly. But they never ask: ""Why, oh why, Don't we raise our voices to the sky?"" Instead you're mute and fawn,  Just waiting to die, Like some kind of hopeless housewife. But you can change while you're alive And let 'em all know At least you tried To kill the demons inside. Oh me oh my... Damn your transcendental paralysis, We can work together And make sense of this. Don't be so sure you can chuck it all away, You've got to proceed No matter how bad you want to stay. It's a natural cause  And a comfort zone There in your head. And the world turns away As you tap the snooze button in bed, But nobody can hear a word you said. Your history was never read. Instead you're mute and fawn,  Just waiting to die, Like some kind of hopeless housewife. But you can change while you're alive And let 'em all know At least you tried To kill the demons inside.        "
214,         There's a world outside but I can't really make it There's a life to lead but I can't exactly fake it Yet the mood feels right But my island is sinking out of sight I made jetties so they'd catch all the sediment Removed the rocks and every impediment But the tide's rising high to wash away my island in the night The sheltering sky was to be my everlasting lullaby They said that islands were solid as bedrock Standing firm forevermore But over time even basement wastes away to the unrelenting shore There's a lonely seed waiting to be planted I've instructions but desire is wholly absent I'm just a petrel in the storm My island can't protect me anymore        
215,"         How do you know what you can be If you can't see where you are going? What breaks the silence, misery Can make you see where you belong. It's a dangerous stage, but the show must go on. Why do you lie, why do you lie? Would you betray your soul? Why do you lie, why do you lie? Don't let your weakness show. You just might be the last to know. Freedom is such a loaded word, So full of hurt and such aplomb. Loneliness saunters in its breeze, Like a disease it drags along. The time of your life can't be had for a song. Why do you lie, why do you lie? Would you betray your soul? Why do you lie, why do you lie? Don't let your weakness show. You just might be the last to know. Why do you lie, why do you lie? Would you betray your soul? Why do you lie, why do you lie? Don't let your weakness show. Why do you lie, why do you lie? Only the meek follow. Why do you lie, why do you lie?Trample the fear below. You just might be the last to know.        "
216,"         The quickening is an ephemeral thing That only happens in the dark Like catching lightning in a jar. And the pain that it brings Is just the promise of Spring. It’s madness on the wing. Oh, what does it mean... To come alive? To come alive! To come alive! The entering is soulful conjecturing * Oh lost and by the wind-grieved ghost Come back to me again. Because the way that she bleeds Is in the law that he reads, Confusing words and deeds. So what does it mean... To come alive? To come alive! To come alive! To pierce the vein of the sacred and profane, Poor science in service of a faith, But who will bear the mark of Cain? To come alive? To come alive! To come alive! * Look Homeward Angel from Thomas Wolfe        "
217,"         Seeds of rebellion lay outside your front door. If you nourish them and water them they'll grow into a healthy ""what for?"" And if revolution isn't what's in store, how can you care anymore? It's a dangerous slip, a conscientious shift. In the spirit of resistance you gotta hold your grip Lest the state of your resolve makes you quickly devolve to a  fundamentalist. You're an archetype, they can pin to the wall When you cling to all convictions like a farm animal in its stall, Never thinking of the bigger world outside, as they take you for a ride. It's a dangerous slip, a conscientious shift. In the spirit of resistance you gotta hold your grip. Because passion unabated can be readily conflated as belligerence. It's a dangerous slip, a conscientious shift. The spirit of resistance you gotta hold your grip. And the verdict won't be kind, 'cuz they're desperate for a viable  alternative. Take a stance. The Resist stance.  Take a stance. The Resist stance.  Take a stance. The Resist stance.  Take a stance. The Resist stance!        "
218,"         You want prosperity For yourself, but not for me. Somehow you just can't see We're in this collectively. You think that freedom is A drastic severance From your past relations Just a quest for new bargains. We're not the same person, We're not the same person. Don't even wanna know. Wo-o-oh. Don't need no good advice Nor shoddy merchandise, I'm the suspect device Beaten down, unable to strike. We're not the same person, We're not the same person. Don't even wanna know. Wo-o-oh. And the sun comes over us again, We lament, we pine, and we rescind And we ask for understanding, But aren't we the stingy ones indeed When it's needed from us in the end? We watch the days go by, Compete and then we die. So few ever ask why, But so many just abuse the design. We're not the same person, We're not the same person. Don't even wanna know. Wo-o-oh.

219,"         Neighbors, nobody loves you like we do. Neighbors, your government has triumphed in finally making you a public fit for the 21st century.  Never before has a governing body shown so much concern for the economic well-being of its subjects.  Today we have insulated you from countless factions who threathen your financial viability such as the poor; the idealistic foreigners still clinging to their childish notions of social welfare. Why, you're even kept uninformed of useless propagandist journalism that reports alleged violations of human rights (We all know they wouldn't have been punished if they hadn't been doing something wrong!).  And who better to dispense such blantantly evident factoids but a self-appointed authority like myself?  Acid rain is a thing of the past...  Too many possible causes, too little signifigance for our modern thinking public, besides, industrial manufacturing is at an all time low anyway, who needs those narrow minded laborers.  Too many mouths to feed, and to many burden on the pay roll! Who needs 'em here in the land of the free time? Some other ass-backward country will give us what we need by exploiting its uneducated children anyway. The Internet has expanded our ability to pacify average Americans better than ever by offering fantastical adventures to every corner of the imagination. Your home office is the window to your world and the heart of your social life. Such reclusive behavior helps clear the roads and public works from overburden like the lower middle-class and others who depend shamelessly on their government. Today you are freer than ever to do what you want, provided you can pay for it! Remember, the first word in USA is US. We have arrived, neighbors, we are the privileged elite!        "
220,"         Desolate and without purpose, Radiating from so many septic sources, Forming the fabric of a wayward people, Disappearing as the vestiges of our past. Scratched like tartan into virgin soil, A substrate for progress and disarray, A spreading network of broken dreams Searching for a thoroughfare to take us away. Just a little tale from the streets of America, (say a little prayer) Sparkled promises paved with pathos and hysteria, Trenchant, weary native sons, Step back and see the damage done, Meander to the horizon, (shoot straight to the horizon) The streets of America. Black, tarred concrete pine for me Lying dormant for you and country, Hardened surface cracked within Catch the sweat from off of the chin. Of men and women, Senior and child Who look to you and your sterile miles And in their stares is bald dismay For what you promised led them astray. Hard-cracked, daunting, lifeless veins, False hope corridors to greener pastures is all that remains.        "
221,"         Oh yeah! A study of history  Reveals an unflagging appeal to mystery. You talk about abstraction  At the top of the list, But you might as well get pissed,  'Cause in me the essence does not exist. No! Yeah yeah! You’re so shallow. How can your romance hope to be  The veil of an ersatz human nature  That can pacify but never slept well  When there’s the pretension of living a lie? Take me as I am, judge me for my crimes, I can say I’ll behave freely all the time. You can predict what I’ll say, it’s in my DNA, But soon I’ll be a catalogue number anyway. So say a little prayer, Convince yourself that someone cares. All I am is what you see. There is nothing more than the surface of me,  There is nothing more than the surface of me!  You know? Oh yeah! Apologies to Skinner,  But I do believe that I feel like I’m a winner Having just discovered a long solved modal secret  Of how I always feel  So goddamn downtrodden and desperate. Take me as I am, judge me for my crimes, I can say I’ll behave freely all the time. You can predict what I’ll say, it’s in my DNA, But soon I’ll be a catalogue number anyway. So say a little prayer, Convince yourself that someone cares. All I am is what you see. There is nothing more than the surface of me,  There is nothing more than the surface of me!         "

223,"         Since the start of the 17th century, There's been the scent of unseasoned wood burning in the air And the conquest of nature meant nothing at all, While we betray exception, we take all that's there. Motives are translucent in the reflection of shame, The actions ghostly remnants of our ancestral ways And unwittingly, you just take your place in this parade. The voracious march of godliness makes us all the same anyway, All the same. Since the dawn of our human family, There's been concentrated sepsis blowing in the breeze And we turned on each other with ferocity, Desperation, forced without reprieve. But the missions were misguided and the trammel led astray, The air resounds with thunder as the victors seized the day And the haunting voice of history lives ignored but not betrayed. The voracious march of godliness will get us close to heaven one day, Some day... The voracious march of godliness makes us all the same anyway, All the same...        "
224,"         You've got to quit your little charade and join the freak parade Now that your road has been paved from conception to your grave. Enormous things to do, others' practices to eschew, To be better than you is impossible to do, But the world won't stop without you. No, the world won't stop without you. Your achievements are unsurpassed, you are highly-ordered mass, But you can bet your ass your free energy will dissipate. Two billion years thus far, now mister here you are, An element in a sea of enthalpic organic compounds. The world won't stop without you. The world won't stop without you. You're only as elegant as your actions let you be A piece of chaos related phylogenetically To every living organ system, we're siblings, don't you see? The earth rotates and will revolve without you constantly. Two billion years thus far, now mister here you are, An element in a sea of enthalpic organic compounds. The world won't stop without you. No, the world won't stop without you. I said the world won't stop without you.        "
225,"         Despite that he saw blatant similarity, He struggled to find a distinctive moiety. All he found was vulgar superficiality, But he focused it to sharpness And shared it with the others. It signified his anger and misery. Them and us, Lobbying determined through a mire of disbelievers, Them and us, Dire perpetuation and incongruous insistence, That there really is a difference Between them and us. Hate is a simple manifestation Of the deep-seated self-directed frustration. All it does is promote fear and consternation. It's the inability To justify the enemy And it fills us all with trepidation. Them and us, Bending the significance to match a whimsied fable, Them and us,Tumult for the ignorant and purpose for the violence, A confused loose alliance forming Them and us. I heard him say We can take them all. But he didn't know who we were And he didn't know who they were. And there wasn't any reason Or motive or value to his story, Just allegory, imitation glory, And a desperate feeble search for a friend. Them and us, Lobbying determined through a mire of disbelievers, Them and us, Dire perpetuation and incongruous insistence, Tumult for the ignorant and purpose for the violence, A confused loose alliance forming Them and us. We can take them all...        "
226,"         Shut your eyes, See the future's distant shore. March ahead, More enlightened than before. And there's sure to be bumps and distractions, But I know we'll get through. There will be me, there will be you, There will be a way. Unresolved repercussions from your life Fortified with the vitriol of strife. And you can be gridlocked by predictions, But you're wise, grab the prize. Then revise, realize There will be a way. And I don't know where we are going, But we're here on this ride And we'll stand side by side All along the way. Follow me to the future's distant shore,Vagary needn't haunt us anymore And now it's time to set the agenda. Learn the past, make it last, Share the wealth, hold your fire, Conserve life, make it right, Kill the hate, negotiate. There will be a way.        "
227,"         Part One From the bird and the deer who live on the same To the condominiums that litter the plain, It took time... time and disregard. From the green and the trees that shot high in the air To the high-business market-men who take all that's there, It took time... time and disregard. Part Two One more acre, another tree, ""It's all untamed, of course it's free."" One more acre, it seems no one cares, ""Another great chance to put a building there."" Part Three I used to roam, wherever I would, I'd see my friends and I'd eat what I could. We did live together in our borderless state, Survival our instinct, nature our fate . Today I see borders and my friends disappear, Man chooses my fate thus I live in fear, Tomorrow the trucks come, I've nowhere to run, My home is destroyed so they can have fun. Part Four From the wild natural wonderland from which we all came To the cement and metal that lost all the game It took time... time and disregard...        "
228,"         The brown and orange sky holds its breath As the sun retreats to the distant horizon, And our hearts palpitate anxiously as we soon will lay supine And wait for sleep to overcome us. And from somewhere in our black, Subconscious minds when we're asleep, Comes a haunting swelling mass of voices, Resonating, its screams of forgotten victims and the cries of innocence, And the desperate plea for recognition and recompense. Tiny voices, echoes of our heritage, Our long and sallow faces turn the other way, Tiny voices, harbored deep within As we outwardly deny that they have something to say, And if we don't confront them they will never go away. The billions of tiny pinhole embers fade into a morning sky Filled with poignant morose wonder, Waking we bear a cosmetic peace that verifies the turmoil That we carry deep inside. And from somewhere in our black, Subconscious minds when we're asleep, Comes a haunting swelling mass of voices, Resonating, its screams of forgotten victims and the cries of innocence, And the desperate plea for recognition and recompense.

229,"         Not long ago, and yet the image is so vague I hesitate to label it a memory, There was a show of local color and I felt astray 'Cuz I had nothing to offer but insufficiency. And you know that it’s a bitch When you learn to scratch that itch, A blatant fallibility, Sooner to some, but eventually... All gets pointed in the same direction While the human masses and their vague conceptions Obliterate each other with impunity, And you wonder ""What’s in this for me?"" To another abyss - to no avail, The search is bound to fail. To another abyss - to no avail, So long ago I set sail. And it chills me to the bone That I’m so far away from home. To another abyss. So what should I do now? What should I celebrate Given finite means and a penchant to depreciate? How can I still avow and depend upon a state That cares nothing for my happiness, welfare or fate? And I know I can’t explain The commotion in my brain, Like a terrifying reality, Deconstructed but inadequately... All gets pointed in the same direction While the human masses and their vain conceptions Obliterate each other with impunity, And release the weight of history. To another abyss - to no avail, The search is bound to fail. To another abyss - to no avail, So long ago I set sail. And it chills me to the bone That I’m so far away from home. To another abyss. So long ago, I set sail And I’m struggling on the way And I’m waiting for the day (To another abyss)  And I’m looking for the way back home. (To another abyss) (To another abyss) So far away, (To another abyss) So far away, (To another abyss) So far away... (To another abyss)        "
230,"         Every day we profit so,  Leaning towards the great unknown, Asking how it pertains to tomorrow. Aim for places we've not been,Trample paths that go between, Yesterday's foundations and tomorrow. It's the way they say it's got to be, We spear ahead and forge our destiny. Who do they represent? Who do you believe? Make a sound decision for others to heed. Try to set a faster pace, Try to build a master race, One that will make a contribution to tomorrow. It's the way they say it's got to be, We put aside our fears and make history. The clothes are in the dryer and the writing is on the wall, We're doing everything we can to stop this fall. Everyday we profit so, Leaning towards the great unknown.        "
231,"         A refreshing plunge, a drink of palatable water, A deep inspiration on a warm summer day. A safe stroll in a middle of the road community, A neighbor who in times of need will not turn away. I ain't no politician, I am a citizen And I wonder if I'm thinking too far out of bounds. Community protection, rehabilitation, Police that serve without legitimate right to maim. Global awareness, ecological guilt, Cultural and environmental awakening. I ain't no optimist, I try to be a realist And I think that we're living too far out of bounds. Is it too much to ask? Could it be the earth is shrinking? I can see the walls closing in, No one can take much for granted anymore. Remote control, three cars for every family, Corruption at the expense of the simple majority. A violent clash, a plunder of the third world, Any wretched ploy that bolsters our economy. I ain't no blind supporter, I'm a conscious citizen And I know that we're living too far out of bounds. I ain't no politician, I ain't no blind supporter, I ain't no vegetable  I am a citizen and I wonder if I'm living too far out of bounds Is it too much to ask? Can we keep the earth from sinking? I can see the walls closing in No one can take much for granted anymore (You better not take it for granted anymore) I'm not taking nothing for granted anymore        "
232,"         Unrepentant vagabond Plot the new coordinates and cast the map aside Now I gotta ramble on Navigate the pitfalls and cross the great divide The mapmaker's legend gave direction and a key He set the declination but what good is it to me?   I can't see the rationality The world's not my responsibility And happiness isn't there for me But maybe I'll inch closer to the source When I find true north (with or without a friend. Keep searching 'til the end.)   Tempting fate and cheating death No one ever told me it was going to be like this Contemplate the randomness When the mind is willing it gets downright perilous   Overburdened, underwhelmed, their ethical decree That's your moral compass but what good is it to me?   I can't see the rationality The world's not my responsibility And happiness isn't there for me But maybe I'll inch closer to the source When I find true north (with or without a friend.

233,"         I had a friend who kept a candle in his pocket, He used to touch it when the wind was blowing high, I guess it made him feel like he could buck the system  And when it flickered out we laid him down to die. Turn on the light,  Turn on a million blinding  brilliant white incendiary lights,  A beacon in the night,  I'll burn relentlessly  Until my juice runs dry. I'll construct a rack of tempered beams and trusses  And equip it with a million tiny suns,  I'll install upon the roof on my compartment  And place tinfoil on my floor and on my walls. Turn on the light,  Turn on a million blinding  brilliant white incendiary lights,  A beacon in the night,  I'll burn relentlessly  Until my juice runs dry.

235,"         There's a light on in the hallway, So I can't understand Why you hide underneath the covers. There's a baby in your womb, So don't be scared tonight Raggedy Ann is in the closet picking posies. Two babies in the dark,  Like diamonds in the sand, While papa's far away making up children's stories. The little one's inside, So afraid to be alone, She's trying to be brave until the daddy comes home. So if you chance to see her, Please tell her it's alright 'Cause everyone fights the tendency to snap. Sometimes it's not a matter of being brave and strong 'Cause noises in the house are terrifying. Two babies in the dark,  Like diamonds in the sand, While papa's far away making up children's stories. The little one's inside, So afraid to be alone, She's talking to herself now 'cause no one's home.

238,"         What will prove to be our big mistake? Short-sighted arrogance all for what sake? Our families to ashes, our ambitions to dust, Our progeny in silence thinking ""what about us?"" But don't forget the dance of neglect, The march for empowering prosperity, The pain from loss and want for mere lucidity. Just maternal residue, and I was there too, And maybe so were you. When something is won, it comes with sacrifice. It's there beneath the joy, the glory and pride, And rarely it's acknowledged but in positive light Consciously omitting the losers' plight. But don't forget the dance of neglect, The craving for community that never was met, The longing for status and the overture of regret. With no one to deter, pathetically unsure, Forgetting who they were. Just maternal residue, and I was there too, And maybe so were you.        "
239,"         The velveteen and oaken fixtures soothed the lonely child, The parents watched the escort take him while they stood outside. The priest was kind and gentle as he positioned his head, The pain was like brimstone, but the kid hardly bled. Victory, instinct over intellect. Victory, it erupts from deep inside. History, history is laughing at us, Plotting its discovery. Victory, victory, Blame it on the victory. Among the parade crowd there stands a decorated man Remembering how he helped to save this sacred land. His helpless enemy was wounded, both hands raised with hope. He killed him without second thought with brute force and a rope. Victory, instinct over intellect. Victory, it erupts from deep inside. History, history is laughing at us, Plotting its discovery. Victory, victory, Blame it on the victory. So many times, so many lives test the other side Waiting to see what the maker has in mind. The unsuspecting commoners hum diligent each day, They wallow in their father's sins, as time passes away. The crimes are without motive but they ignore all restraint, The evil sits inside them torpid timing its escape. Victory, instinct over intellect. Victory, it erupts from deep inside. History, history is laughing at us, Plotting its discovery. Victory, victory, Blame it on the victory.        "

242,"         Shut off the TV and peel off those sunday gloves, And I'll stain the clean that you've been counting. Old Mr. Fletcher passed by here today, After 40 years of toil he just stood up and walked away. Fantastic the panic that showed in his eyes, He shrugged when I asked him about it. He said, ""young man, pay heed, listen well to what I say, Now there comes a time for a man to walk away."" Walk away (walk away), I'll be a parade, And I'll be determined that no one shall dissuade On my way, I'll sure take some time To burn all the bridges that I'm leaving behind. He passed by again and he was shivering from the cold, I'm not sure but I think that he was trying. He told me about the weather and something old to pay, ""But tomorrow"", he said, ""I'm gonna surely walk away."" Walk away (walk away), I'll be a parade, And I'll be determined that no one shall dissuade On my way, I'll take my sweet time To burn all the bridges that I'm leaving behind.        "
243,"         I was born on planet earth, The rotating ball where man comes first. It's been around for a long, long time, But now it's time to watch it die. I saw a man on my big blue screen, He ruled the world economy. He said the rich would never concede, But some day soon he'll be put to sleep. I've seen the life of the forest green And adaptations of the deep blue sea. And who knows who is the fittest, They will all soon be put to rest. On a plunging flight and we're sitting In the pilots seat in the midst of life, People on a dark horizon praying Somebody will save their lives. I was born on planet earth, At a drastic time full of plastic mirth, And every day I've seen increasing signs, And you would too if you'd opened your eyes, You had a chance, you did not try, So now it's time to watch it die.

245,"         So you waste another day getting older and gray in the head, And you're hearing lots of stories 'bout the happy times you have ahead. There are other folks in power so you kick back and get farther behind, And although the world rotates itself the only thing you twist is your mind. You see, the world's falling apart at the rifts, And surprisingly, the leaders can't make any sense of it. You mean nothing to the world, we're all someone else's fool, But oh, what can you do? ""Yeah you waste your time with losers if you get stuck in a rock-n-roll band."" Do you find it more rewarding to compete with morons throughout this land?

246,"         There's a purpose, there's a goal, There's virtuous, and immoral, There's a reason for all of this And I don't know what it is! I am one, and plural too, I accept them, but they exclude, I could make sense of all of this, But I don't know what it is! The seeds of inspiration never germinated in my mind, The beacon of awakening is somewhere that I can't find.  So I don't know what it is... There's a beginning, and there's an end, There's a climax, some would contend, There's a way to signify this, But I don't know what it is!

247,"         I've seen a lot of things in five years, I struggle just to hold back the tears, But every-fucking-where I go, I see the pathos that I know Will spell the termination of us all. Someone's got to tell me, do you see That everything around you has a hidden tragedy? Seeds of happiness have never found a place to grow, And our generation doesn't know. When, when will you try To change the logarithmic pace of kissing things goodbye? When, when will you know That human life is so short, and death is oh-so-slow? I've tried to make things make sense, but I can't, I'm happy just to watch them all and laugh. And if you think you've got it made, Just revel in your selfish ways, 'Cause when the world stops turning, so will you!        "
248,"         Smacked back tarmac stars are scars of fame In the place where no one knows me by my name Where tar pit drips its drilled out vein And fashion trips on tangled skein If you need to slake that aching in your brain This is where the fun is This is where the fun is In the shadow of the valley Where the nights are warm We will fear no evil When we get things done Tap in - into the vain We'll road trip and raise Cain Down on the nickel With a flame in the rain This is where the fun is This is where the fun is This is where the fun is This is where the fun is This is where So, jump in - into the frame We're laughin' to hide the pain It's not a riddle we're all a little, a little amazed This is where the fun is This is where the fun is This is where the fun is This is where the fun is This is where the fun is This is where the fun is This is where the fun is This is where the fun is.

249,"         All those stories that my dad told me, They are just a whisper in time. All those things that never came to be, They are just a whisper in time. A whisper in time, a whisper in time, Things that I can't shake from my mind. A whisper in time, a whisper in time, Moments that just flicker and die. All those places I wanted to go, They are just a whisper in time. All those friends who now I do not know, They are just a whisper in time. A whisper in time, a whisper in time, Things that I can't shake from my mind. A whisper in time, a whisper in time, Moments that just flicker and die.

'Cuz we are messengers of memory Just whispers in time.        "
250,"         Wasted children, fixed blank eyes, blood and sweat, we socialize  Broken home from which they come, beer-stained dad, compliant Mom. Fear and love, much despised, replaced by comfortable lies. Teenage classic, more cliche, one step further on the edge of decay. White trash, 2nd generation, white trash, 2nd generation, White trash, 2nd generation, don your crown and cleanse the nation. Are you ready to fight for your morality? Right wing allies, white supremacy. Pretty fascist on the tube draped in red and white and blue.

251,"         It's cold again, it looks like rain. A procession of humanity, strikingly simian,Saunters by, I can't explain Why it's troubling to see them so. Better than who we are with mania  And yearning for and learning from, Better than holiness and candy aisles  Of loneliness and sweet revenge. A cigarette, a memory, All connections to the permanent are burning. The pedestal gets in the way And cannot withstand our honest scrutiny. Better than who we are with mania  Or standing for or dead against, Better than holiness and candy aisles  Of loneliness and sweet revenge. Do you feel the chill of December In the rioting of Spring? And are we made of something better than clay? A leap, a fight, a secret rite, The lonely quest for meaning and the universe is dreaming. Better than who we are with mania  And yearning for and learning from, Better than holiness and candy aisles  Of loneliness and sweet revenge. Oh, sweet revenge...        "

The end is almost here, the sky, the air, so nice and clear, The sound of your decay, And the ringing in the air is the screen-debris of yesterday. There, now that you know it's not so bad. See, the good things soon flow proximate. So few try to enhance, we don't deserve another chance. Just laugh along the way, And kiss your ass goodbye with a shadowed dream of yesterday. Yesterday, the good old days. Yesterday, the way we used to play. Yesterday, it just got worse and worse. Yesterday, the future's been rehearsed. Run, but don't be scared to look behind. Stop, don't wait too long, make up your mind. The end is almost here, the sky, the air, so nice and clear, The sound of your decay, And the ringing in the air is the screen-debris of yesterday.

256,"         There's a place where everyone can be happy. It's the most beautiful place in the whole fucking world. It's made of candy canes and planes and bright red choo-choo trains, And the meanest little boys and the most innocent little girls. And you know I wish that I could go there. It's a road that I have not found. And I wish you the best of luck, dear. Drop a card or letter to my side of town. Because there's no time for fussing and fighting my friend, But baby, I'm amazed at the hate that you can send and You... painted my entire world. But I... don't have the turpentine to clean what you have soiled. And I won't forget it. There's a place where everyone can be right, Even though you remain determined to be opposed. Admittance requires no qualifications: It's where everyone has been and where everybody goes. So please try not to be impatient, For we all hate standing in line. And when the farm is good and bought, you'll be there without a thought, And eternity, my friend, is a long fucking time. Because there's no time for fussing and fighting my friend, But baby, I'm amazed at the hate that you can send and You... painted my entire world. But I... don't have the turpentine to clean what you have soiled. And I won't forget it.        "
257,"         Hey sit down and listen and they'll tell you when you're wrong. Eradicate but vindicate as ""progress"" creeps along. Puritan work ethic maintains its subconscious edge As Old Glory maintains your consciousness. There's a loser in the house, and a puppet on a stool, And a crowded way of life, and a black reflecting pool, And as the people bend, the moral fabric dies, The country can't pretend to ignore its people's cries. 'Cause you are the government. You are jurisprudence. You are the volition. You are jurisdiction. And I make a difference too.        "
258,"         Hey, you, Is there something worth aspiring to? And can it be found in a record store? Well, it's not there anymore. Just think of all the things we did, We were different Just like all the other kids. Missy was a teen blue video star, Tom took his life in his mother's car. Milo went to college but you knew about that,Rodney played our record, GG started riots, Laurie was always quiet. She was battling depression. Hey, you, Is there something worth belonging to? And can I pick it up for a song Or a diploma or a worthy cause? Well let me tell you that there's nothing wrong, It's just that ones like us will never belong. Jack wore a skirt, but he knew how to scrap, Billy went to county on a class one possession. Wendy went to school while her daddy shot smack,Eugene kept a list, Mugger was security, Mary, she kept her purity. We were all in it together. Yellowed postcards on the wall Serve to cover up a blankness after all, So I will carry them along Like a song when I'm gone, yeah. Hey, you, Is there something worth belonging to? You know we've been here all along Like a confederacy of the wrong. And I confess it could be prejudice But to you I dedicate this song, Yeah to you.        "
